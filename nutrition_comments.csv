I'm thinking that as well, now that things have settled down more in my life, I think it'll be easier to continue. The best thing to me is it doesn't seem like it's cost any more than I thought it would. I'm trying to encourage my partner to eat better too, it's hard because he's a lot pickier than me but also wants to lose weight.

Since you mentioned fatigue, something you might want to consider is tracking your nutrients to make sure youre not deficient in anything. Ive had iron deficiencies a few times before and I would realize it because I would feel really fatigued and occasionally fainted when exercising. I cleaned up my diet a lot and dont have that problem anymore, and tracking my nutrition has helped me know that. But dont feel like you need to do everything all at once! Its a big lifestyle change and its easier to go at your own pace, which it sounds like youve been doing. There are free apps for it so it doesnt have to be a manual process.

And yeah, having stability in life definitely helps with forming habits and reducing stress. Ive realized that too.","1_1_1"
"avt2020",2,2,"Yes! I almost never get chips because the lays ones make me feel so sick too. 

I'm going to try to track that once I start getting the hang of it all because I'm sure I'm deficient in at least something. I try to get plenty of meat and I'm trying to have fruit/veg with every meal, make it easier to grab it for a snack too so I'm hoping with time I'll get better. I'll have to take a look at some of those apps, because it is hard to keep track of even fiber myself just by looking at everything. 

It really does help, I feel like I thrive the most with some structure. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to go with making some of my meals but I'll figure it out. I want to lose this weight more than anything and keep it off for a change!","1_1_1_1"

Also, I know you're asking about healthy meal ideas so apologies for the unsolicited advice but 1300-1500 calories a day is extremely low, even for losing weight, for someone of your size and sex. For someone with a history of binge eating, I would be very cautious about trying to lose weight at such an extreme calorie deficit. I input your info into the calorie calculator linked below(I used sedentary so if you exercise your counts would be even higher) and even for extreme weight loss it is recommending 1800 calories a day. Although the people who see the most success with weight loss usually go slow and steady, in which case you could be eating up to 2,500 calories a day. Just something to think about!

I second what others have said: how you cook vegetables makes a huge difference. Growing up, most of the vegetables I had were boiled or raw and I was not a fan.

"NamelessDragon30",3,3,"Depends if this is your first time quitting sugar/highly processed foods. And depends if you actually cut ALL of it out (processed foods/simple carbs - natural sugar like fruit and honey don't count). 

In my experience, it takes me 4 days for the cravings to die out after eating a lot of sugar/ultra processed foods. But if I just ""cut it back"", but still eat even a little bit of it (like even half a chocolate bar for example) then the cravings just never go away. However, I've been eating whole foods strictly for a while and only rarely eat sugar/ultra processed foods. 

The first time I tried cutting it out I'm sure it took months of back and forth because of how heavy cravings were. But eventually, you can go longer and longer without eating those addictive foods until cravings are very very faint and easy to ignore.

Your mesenteric nervous system, the brain that controls your gut, is heavily influenced by the bacteria in your gut--- that bacteria will actually communicate with your nervous system by sending out chemical to communicate with your brain. If you've been eating refined sugars, the bacteria in your gut that thrive on sugar proliferate at the expense of bacteria that thrive on healthier food options. As those bacteria starve, they send chemicals to your mesenteric nervous system to demand sugar so they don't starve. As those bacteria starve out, they're outperformed and displaced by bacteria that thrive on the healthier food options.

Eating healthy is very similar to gardening your gut biome in that regard. Eventually the bacteria in your gut will be mainly the ones that crave the food that happens to be healthier for you, and then send signals craving that food.","2"

"somuchmt",3,3,"Part of the pleasure of sweet and salty snacks is their texture and their bite-sized or munchable shapes. Here are a few things that help me:

* Make a huge salad for pretty much all day munching. Cut the veggies into appealing shapes (I love julienned carrots, thinly sliced radishes, etc.). Include a huge array of different things, like fresh or dehydrated fruits, nuts, olives, artichoke hearts, pickles, crumbled crackers or corn chips, sunflower or pumpkin seeds, canned corn, canned seasoned black beans. My enormous salads keep me too busy to eat dessert, lol.
* Make a veggie tray with hummus or peanut butter dip, and cut the veggies into perfectly dippable bite-sized pieces.
* Grapes are incredibly satisfying. I can eat just a few, and it helps with those sugar cravings--and can actually make me feel quite full. A couple of dried figs or a few dates are also nice dessert replacers.
* Make a trail mix. An easy one is just raisins, peanuts, and chocolate or carob chips. Not exactly low calorie, and still sugary, but you get somewhat more nutrients for those calories.
* Make it a rule that you have to make your own desserts--and stop buying store-bought ones. Check out recipes that use beans or chickpea flour to try to add more nutrients to each calorie. Or make your own larabars out of dehydrated fruits.
* Instead of a bag of cookies, have a lemon drop. It's still a quick sugar hit, but has less empty calories.
* Make a deal with yourself to only have desserts one day a week. You don't have to quit desserts entirely, just make sure that 80-90% of your diet is healthy, instead of the 50% it's at now.
* Get back on the wagon when you fall off, and don't beat yourself up.","2"

I dont have a good suggestion on replacing cookies. Maybe cookie flavoured protein bars? Or make your own healthier, low sugar cookies?

Ill give myself a little leeway if someone else is offering or its at a party but I will spend absolutely no money on sweets and dont keep them in my home.

The other thing is to make sure that I am eating nutritious food before I have a treat.

"Deondebomon",1,1,"I have a couple of suggestions, some more practical than others.

The simplest solution, of course, is to not buy it. I know that sounds hard, but hear me out. So, the way I do it, to cut down on snacks I know I will binge-eat is to allocate a certain amount of money to snacks each week. And, here's the hardest part, once I've spent that money for the week, *I cannot buy any more snacks.* ***None***\*.\* No matter what the reason is. If I still super want it after I spent my snack money, I have to make it from scratch.

A second suggestion (though impractical) is to get braces. For a while your teeth will hurt so much you won't be able to eat. And yes, I learned this the hard way, and the incidental side effect of not eating as many snacks was not anticipated.

My third suggestion goes back to a little more practical; free cookies and candy are really hard to pass up, I know. So set yourself goals. If you use mfp, (I switched to mynetdiary a bit back, but used to use it), get a step tracker you can sync with it, and learn how many steps it takes to burn off one cookie. For those free work cookies, tell yourself you HAVE to take that many steps before you're allowed to eat it. Or, if since you're at work walking a half hour then and there is impractical, tell yourself you can eat the cookie now but NO MORE snacks until you've walked it off. The hard part is staying accountable to yourself, so I further suggest finding a walking buddy. Set whatever schedule works for the both of you and go on walks until you get that half hour or whatever time you've set in.

A fourth suggestion is, when you buy cookies (or other snacks) pull them out of the package immediately and portion them out into their own containers or ziploc bags. Label each portioned part with the day or meal you wanted to have it at, and stick to it. If it's all labeled already and portioned out, maybe it will be a little harder to binge-eat them? Also see my first suggestion...if all your snacks for the week are portioned out AND you know you can't buy more for a full 7 days maybe that will help you choose not to eat them all at once.

A fifth suggestion...maybe impractical for you, maybe not. Go back to wearing a mask at work to bypass those free snacks. I haven't stopped wearing a mask at work since covid started, and I found that it very much stops me from snacking quite as much since I would then have to take off the mask in order to eat, which I don't usually feel comfortable doing if I'm out at the desk facing customers.

And one last suggestion...find something to do with both your hands. That is, something that you absolutely cannot eat while doing. When I'm in a munchy mood and I know I've had more than my share of calories for the day, I try to knit or crochet, since who wants to get crumbs on that stuff? Crumbs definitely are not a great accent on yarn. Also I play video games, which I won't eat while doing since I absolutely want my controller to stay nice and clean and not get gummed up with crumbs and stuff.

Edit to add: Also gum. Have you tried chewing on gum instead of eating snacks? No, it isn't at all the same, but especially if you choose a mint gum you may not even want to eat the snacks after since they won't taste good! Mint candy is good for that too. (A mint lifesaver has way less calories than a cookie :P )","10"

A good dressing and meat generally in bulk or from the actual butcher counter will be best- you can request any meat in pounds general.

At 29, I now buy a lot of more lux items that I prefer: free range eggs etc, but starting out buy some generic items and start to pay attention to how you go through them, what you use the most and least of and that will help you decide how to budget. For instance you can also really spice ramen up with bacon, veggies, an egg and some soy sauce to help. 

Bagged items, like orange chicken etc and rice/garbanzo beans go very far. Buying items dry, like beans and rice will help a lot too. 

Lastly: it takes a lot of time to figure out how to eat as an adult. The same tastes you had at home might not be met, or also might be easy to exceed. Trader Joes is generally inexpensive, but processed foods are easier to make and sometimes seem cheaper, but learning how to cook foods you really like helps a lot. 

Also, learn to cook as you go. Videos and tutorials can help make really inexpensive items really delicious. Dont shop on an empty stomach. You can pull apart banana clumps to buy less and again, buying from the butcher counter will help you save money by not buying in bulk. Shop sales. Buying two dozen eggs when they are BOGO is very helpful. Freeze nuts and dry goods like oats and beans when you get home so insects dont hatch from them.

If cauliflower mash works better for you, have you tried adjusting textures on other fruits/vegetables in a similar way?

 There are many puree-style soups (if that texture works?), or you could mash/puree your own vegetables (a stick blender often works well, but do not use it with potatoes - the starches go 'stretchy' in an unpleasant (to me) way.)

If you have access to a freezer, many vegetables freeze better than you'd expect, especially when mashed or pureed. Meaning if you find something that works, you could do a big batch and freeze for later.

Even adjusting cooking styles can make a huge difference (Raw/roasted/slow cooked/stir fry/boiled/steamed/steamed longer). Different cooking styles make most vegetables into completely different dishes.

In my country, there's a range of pre-pureed foods targeted towards people with chewing/eating issues. Baby food is another example of easily available texture modified options, although I assume that option may get quite expensive with tiny serving styles.

My point is that there's nothing wrong with thinking outside the box for solutions to an out of the box issue. There are some ways to access different textures without doing it yourself.

Eating fruit means eating the fiber, carbohydrates and fructose within the pulp of the fruit which your gut microbiome has to digest for you. They are filling.

Fiber and complex carbs take time to digest and some of that feeds your gut, too. So, the glucose is delivered into your bloodstream at a slower rate, slowing the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.

All glucose is glucose to the body and does trigger insulin release, it's just a matter of how much. 

So if you can choose, choose sugar that's wrapped up in nutrients, vitamins and most importantly, fibers. This way you're not just eating empty calories but getting filled while you eat something we all enjoy. 

Generic candy is a high GI, high calorie, non nutritious, non willing food. A mildly sweet apple is packed with vitamins and fiber so it's a more filling, low calorie snack. Both result in insulin release upon consumption but the apple would result in a less steep insulin release curve.","2"

Bacteria in your gut can actually communicate with your nervous system and give you food cravings. If you eat bad food, you select for a population of gut bacteria that thrive off of sugar.

Just like a garden, it takes awhile to get everything blooming and you need to constantly weed to ensure that you dont have the sugar-loving bacteria taking hold.

I can maybe boil some green beans but they probably won't come out as good as my grandma's or most restaurants and these are the chopped up kind too. Either way I never tried to step outside of my comfort zone of just getting fast food or warming up frozen pizzas or hot pockets or instant noodles/chicken soup, so quite simply idk how to cook and the most healthy eating I do is just eating apples and oranges but I feel like the fact I don't eat healthy enough and I malnourished myself cuz I very rarely felt hungry for a while might have left me shorter than I should be.

Youll end up sometimes messing up a dish by overcooking your chicken, or undercooking your pasta but thats part of learning and you should enjoy the ride.

then, maybe try your hand at meal planning yourself, too. cook the perishables the day or day after you purchase them, as they'll stay fresh longer once cooked. and don't overlook freezing the meals you've made, or even buying frozen fruits and vegetables. cooking up an omelet with some frozen broccoli and/or spinach, for example, can take less time than boiling water and cooking a pot of pasta, and you'll get a lot more nutrients out of it. throw it all in a tortilla if you want some carbs.

* Large wraps (buy the large packs and keep them in the freezer)
* Pizza sauce in the large squeezey bottle
* Cheese (a large block keeps better in a zip-lock bag in the fridge and grate it as you need it)
* Pepperoni Salami (slice as you need, keep it in a zip-lock bag and I have found it keeps for up to a month in the fridge)
* Onion
* Optional fresh extras: sliced Mushrooms and Capsicum and if you are buying those add a bag of lettuce (my favourite is rocket, the pepperiness goes nicely with the salami) to make a side salad and you are covering all bases and have left overs for the next day.

"jackieporterhealth",3,3,"I love this question. Thank you for asking it as I know this will apply to many of us here. 

**A few things you need to know:** 

1. Behavior change starts with what the **individual values**. It sounds like your mom really enjoys cooking, and I'm guessing that **she gets a lot of gratification** from making food that all of her friends and family think is tasty (even if it is unhealthy). 
2. **Role modeling healthy behavior** is something you can do and control. It's always tough when you want other people to change for their own well-being, but the reality is that you may want it more than they do. The good news is that your behaviors can influence your mom because at the end of the day, we all want to fit in. 

**Now for the tips:** 

1. If your mom does make something healthy (even if it's a side dish with a meal that's otherwise unhealthy), be sure to **compliment it.** This is called behavioral reinforcement. We know that she likes to make others happy with her cooking, so be sure to take any opportunity to reinforce the right foods she makes. 
2. This can be tough, but if your mom offers you an unhealthy food choice, **politely decline and ask for or make yourself a healthier meal option**. You may also consider asking your mom what she plans to make ahead of time so you can proactively let her know you would like a healthier option. 
3. **Offer to cook for her or have her over for dinner** sometimes so you can show her what eating healthy looks like. 
4. Speak about healthy eating in terms of how it may **align with her values**. For example, if family is important to her, talk to her about how making healthy meals for the grandkids is important for their well-being.

"civis_Romanus_sum23",2,2,"I can give you some pointers:

You say you're getting dizzy often and feel weak. These could be serious signs of iron deficiancy. Might be a good idea to get some suplements or eat more red meat.

As to nutritian, if simply eating more is off the table, you have to make what little you do eat more calory dense. Easyest way to do that would be to add something very calory dense but not hard to eat to your food, for example a spoonfull of butter or peanut butter. In addition to that, you could try drinking your some of food in liquid form, this would solve your chewing and appetite problem as well as the fake fullness from drinking too much water. Make or buy some smoothys or something similar.

At any rate, you don't seem to be eating healthy at all, a diet of ramen noodles is far from ideal and you probably have some serious defciancys as a result. Taking the time out of your day to cook a balanced, nutritious meal may not be easy, but it surtainly beats putting your health at serious risk.

Lastly, keep in mind that any of these tips will only add on mass in fat if you don't exercise regularly, it's essential for keeping healthy and you should absolutley take the time to do so.","2"
"[deleted]",1,1,"Smoothies sounds good. Once school starts, I'll probably be walking a lot and burning a lot more calories than just being at home. 

Am I really putting my health at risk by eating like this? That's kind of scary;; I'll try to have some toast instead occasionally. Thank you for the pointers :)","2_1"
"civis_Romanus_sum23",1,1,"By what I've seen and think, yes, you are seriously endangering your health, and no, just taking some toast occasionally isn't going to cut it. You need a balanced diet, your body needa proteins, fats, carbohydrates as well as a very small ammount of a varaiaty of elements and vitamins. Undersupplying your body with any of these will lead to deficiancys that can manifest in serious conditions. Best known of these would probably be scurvy.

A balanced meal, which you should eat every day should consist of vegetables, a great source for vitamins and other elements, a source of carbohydrates such as rice, potatoes or pasta or even bread and a source of proteins and essential fats such as meat, nuts, mushrooms or meat replacements. You should also eat some fruit regularly, as they are an effective source of vitamins, especially the more sour ones.

I suggest visiting a doctor, it sounds like you have some health problems that go beyond simply diatary ones.","2_1_1"
"le-chacal",1,1,"Add sardines, mackerel, eggs, butter, ghee, bone marrow, beef tallow, bone broth to the ramen if you're planning on continuing that. Instant ramen unfortunately isn't very healthy but I suppose you could just add protein and fat to it.

One of the easiest ways to get a boat load of calories is drinking them. If you can handle dairy get some heavy cream, half &amp; half, or whole milk. Drink a glass before bed. Consider buying a whey protein powder and adding a scoop or two to the glass. Goat milk might be a good alternative to dairy.

Almonds, cashews, and avocados are nutrient dense.

With poor diet you're malnourished and need to supplement with vitamins (definitely Vitamin D, A, and C and maybe some omega 3 fatty acids/fish oil if you can get some). Your hormones need to get back on track to get you past this rut. 

Maybe check out r/bodybuilding for healthy bulking. Mentally and physically they're in the same boat as you. You could probably just copy and paste this post right over there. They would definitely suggest placing greater physical demands on your body to crave food. Everyone has to start where they're at and you just gradually turn the dial up. You already know what a lot of these meatheads are just discovering: Gaining is really hard. 

Take a couple minutes to yourself each day and smile even if you don't feel happy. Smile like you're the happiest you've every been until your face hurts. It releases serotonin in your brain.

Cut all negative media out of your life. We tell ourselves lies and it's parasitic. It does take a toll. Be ruthless.

Only think and speak about yourself in positive way. My grandmother always said, ""Be careful with your words. Words are powerful. Don't mutter curses upon yourself. Use your words as a blessing, healing, and comfort for yourself and for others."" 

You're a child of God: ""Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.
Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!""

"Elysiumthistime",1,1,"When you say you can't physically continue eating, is that purely due to the psychological feelings stopping you or do you feel any physical symptoms, such as pains in your abdomen or nausea?

I know you said that you had an ED in the past but it is not an issue anymore, but the way you describe that overwhelming urge to stop eating after a few bites. That complete disinterest in food. To me that sounds like how I get when I go through anorexic phases. I have EDNOS and I flip between anorexic and binge eating periods every couple months to years (for the past 15 years I've fought this). Often anorexia is portrayed as this desire to avoid food in order to lose weight but that hasn't been my experience. When I go through phases of not eating, I lose all sense of appetite, the idea of eating fills me with complete disinterest and at times, boredom. 

I know you said in another comment that you didn't want to speak to your GP but would you consider calling an eating disorder support hotline? To rule that potential out at the least, especially considering your history. Unfortunately ED's have a tendency to change over time and shape-shift into a completely different type of ED, to the point where people aren't aware that they still have an ED.","5"
"[deleted]",1,1,"Mostly psychological feelings but it's also partly because I know that if I eat one more bite, no matter how hungry I am, my body is not going to like it. If I've already lost interest in the food and continue to force it down, I've noticed my body reacts really badly and I spend the night on the toilet or in discomfort. It's also partly due to my idea that food should be enjoyed and so if I'm forcing this down, what's the point in eating it. Thinking of continuing to eat after I lose interest disgusts me sometimes and I start only seeing the cons of the food. If I lose interest halfway through a packet of ramen, it goes from ""this is ok"" to ""who the hell would eat this stuff this is disgusting, I hate how the flour noodles taste so sweet after a while."" 

I'm not intentionally trying to lose weight so I didn't think this was an eating disorder. I have a really bad experience with online hotlines so I don't think that's going to be an option for me but I'm really interested to hear about your take and experience regarding this lack of appetite (if you're ok with sharing). I'll do some googling to see if this might be symptoms of another ED. Thank you :)","5_1"
"Elysiumthistime",1,1,"Honestly, I think this is way past anything anyone online could give you advice about. I appreciate that you said you didn't trust your GP but this sounds like you will need to rule out any medical conditions first. If it's a digestive disorder then that can be helped through different treatments, they could refer you to a dietician to rule out intolerances, they can do bloodwork to see what deficiencies all this limited food intake has resulted in, which will in turn make you feel so much better physically. If they rule all that stuff out then you will be in a much better position to begin down the road of considering if it's something psychologically blocking you're desire to eat. 

I'm absolutely happy to discuss my experience with appetite loss. So initially for me, it was triggered by my Mom passing away and I felt a complete lack of control of everything in my life. Initially I lost my appetite because I was grieving but I soon found comfort in being extremely controlled about what I ate. It was a coping mechanism. I became fixated over my looks and weight later down the road. The last time I had a bad relapse into heavy restricting I was in a very stressful place and I just lost all interest in eating. I felt nothing when I ate, just complete numbness. There was no joy but no guilt either, it felt like a chore. I found myself lying to people about what I had eaten and I lost weight rapidly. The less I ate the less I could stomach. Luckily, because I had been through this before, I was able to catch myself and I reached out to a therapist and sought counselling to get my head back to a more stable place and I was able to pull myself back before it went too far but it's a slippy slope and I strongly believe that ED's are never cured, only managed.","5_1_1"

Please Google intuitive eating and try to get the idea of gaining weight out of your head. If you are relatively healthy, no thyroid problems, physically active and no serious mental health problems driving you to use food as a coping mechanism, then listening to your hunger cues and choosing as minimally processed foods as possible, you will not gain weight and at the very least you will not gain it so quickly that you will not have time to make minor and easy to implement adjustments to your diet and lifestyle to lose it all again without trouble.

If you want to start eating normal, you can and should. You will only gain weight if your daily calorie intake outweighs your calorie output (CICO). i.e. youre supposed to eat 1800 but you eat 2500

Are you scared of gaining weight because you made an effort to lose it? Are you currently a healthy weight? Depending on where you are in your journey, it might make sense to add some exercise. Simple as 15 min walks a stay can make a difference. Or just monitoring what you eat. 

As someone who used to skip breakfast, I actually think breakfast really helps me feel and stay focused / energized throughout the day! So even if you dont want to gain weight, YES, do it, start eating it. Im guessing you want to start eating normal again for this reason.

Another thing to consider is eating fruit and veg with a yummy dip. Like guacamole, Greek yogurt based dip (I like to mix plain yogurt with mashed avocado and seasoninglike cayenne or paprika or garlic powder), or even nut butter or peanut butter for the fruits. My husband likes to snack on apple or pear slices dipped in peanut butter. Charcuterie boards are a great way to try a little assortment of fruit &amp; veg along side other yummy items.","4"

"[deleted]",2,2,"Try to let go of any shame while binging and just focus on what youre actually craving.

It could be that you arent eating enough throughout the day so your body craves a huge amount by the time you get home.  Or is eating emotionally comforting to you?

I found for myself that in wild way a overfilled stomach gave me a similar effect to a tight hug. So it felt like stuffing my face full comforted me a bit while I was stressed. Knowing the route issue was I was looking for comfort. Ive just supplemented my life with other forms of comfort and I binge drastically less.

But overall I would say just try to find that for yourself. First understand that your body is 100% binging for a reason. You may not feel the need nor want to. But your body must be otherwise it wouldnt be happening in the first place. 

So its about listening to what HEALTHY thing your body wants that its getting in an UNHEALTHY way by binging. The body never intends to do anything that causes us harm so if were encountering a habit we dont like its best to look at what is the body using that for to potentially try to help us? Because then we can supplement it with our own help.

Edit: I also want to add I find it very relevant that it happens when you get home. Im guessing thats either from school or from work so that tells me something is happening in that transition from I was there. To now Im here. If school/work is particularly stressful. Or if you feel a lack of control even. Binging may be a way to comfort yourself or to gain a feeling of control.

It may sound wild but sometimes we do destructive things because its what we can control when we cant control other things. Like I may not be able to control how x person treats me but I can control how much I eat. It can be again a way of your body trying to do something to help you. In this example helping by giving a feeling of empowerment.","2"

"[deleted]",1,1,"And think of how innocent that actually is? Imagine a kid thats really stressed out and you find them stuffing their face to calm down. You wouldnt scold or shame them. You would just kindly show them healthier ways to calm down and the next time you notice that theyre stressed. Politely point them in the direction of the alternative ways to calm down.

It fully is the same relationship with the self. Mind vs inner child(body) so its just trial and error and patience about learning what your child needs to help calm down other than food.

Good luck!! Its honestly a super long and hard process BUT the simplest way to do it is from a place of loving relationship with yourself in the parent/child dynamic. And its about patience too.

Equipment: Air fryer

Ingredients:

1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs

1 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder

1 teaspoon onion powder

1 teaspoon garlic powder

¬Ω teaspoon white pepper

¬Ω teaspoon salt

¬Ω teaspoon chili powder

2 teaspoon light soy sauce

2 tablespoon potato starch (sub with corn starch)

2 tablespoon corn starch

Thai basil

Neutral oil (for air fryer basket)

Instructions:

Cut chicken thighs into 1 inch cubes. Pat dry.

Combine five spice powder, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, white pepper, salt, and soy sauce into a bowl. Mix well.

Marinade chicken thighs in spice mix and let sit for 30 minutes.

Prepare air fryer, pre-heat for 7 minutes at 400 F.

While air fryer is pre-heating, potato starch and corn starch. Lightly dredge thigh pieces with starch mix.

Spray the basket with a neutral oil. Place thighs into air fryer and ensure there is space between each piece. Spray the top of the chicken lightly. Cook at 400 F for 6 minutes.

After 6 minutes, turn each piece over and cook for another 6 minutes.

Lower the temperature to 375 F, shake the basket up. Cook for another 4-5 minutes.

In your last batch, spray your basil with a bit of oil and add in for the last 4-5 minutes to crisp up with the chicken.","1_1_1_1"
"notreallylucy",1,1,"So, the corn starch here isn't a thickener, it's a breading. Two tablespoons isn't very much, so you could just use it. If you want an alternative, you could use crushed nuts or pork rinds, both of which make a crunchy coating. You could also sub whole what flour.","1_1_1_1_1"
"LemonBlut",1,1,"The thing is, how to get the same amount of minerals and vitamins that you get with boiled potatoes with skin. I use potatoes to replace the big bad three (Wheat, Rice, Corn (and derivates)). Potatoes are much more dense at a nutritional level. I know they have a high glycemic index, but since skin is eaten too, the fiber in it is also decent and will delay glucose absortion.

And you don't eat potatoes alone. If you get some greens with it, like lettuce, you are already increasing the fiber intake, which will be even better. And if you add some other foods like eggs, you're reducing total glycemic index of the food much more.

Another thing to point is that the number of daily intakes will have an impact in the amount of energy that will be stored as fat. If you have less intakes per day (for example 2 meals with no snacks in between), and have a fasting window between 14 and 18 hours per day, you will be burning lot more fat for the same calorie intake, avoiding hormonal changes derived from severe caloric deficits.

So I think that a high glycemic index is not going to have a real impact if you eat potatoes with other healthy foods such as greens, fiber, proteins and some fats. This will not be the case if the same day that you eat potatoes, you eat high amounts of fructose or sucrose (like 30 g per day of each one), or high fructose corn sirup and sweets.

EDIT: remember drinking the water in which you boiled potatoes because some minerals are leached in the water.","2"
"hayhayhayahi",3,3,"As someone who has almost all of these restrictions and has thyroid issues, you need to be really careful with cross contamination. A restaurant may say they are gluten free but there can be a high chance of gluten, dairy, eggs, etc. that are accidentally introduced to the food. 

Sauces suck. If you dont know exactly whats in them, they can have allergens. I learned this the hard way with soy sauce. 

Snacks are also tricky. They could be gluten, egg, dairy free but are made in a factory that produces the allergens and could have traces of those. 

A lot of this will be based on how his body handles food now. After I was diagnosed, I learned yeast extract gives me headaches, same with bananas. So he could eat something without any allergens and still get a reaction. 

My advice would be to get together and look for places to eat or shop together. At the beginning its really hard to remember all the things that trigger your body. Its been helpful for me to have a list of foods that affect me and the reactions so I can tell others and can go back to it when I dont remember.","1"

2. Brushing my teeth after dinner. Im much much less likely to crave snacks after Ive already brushed my teeth for the night. Its like telling my brain Im closed for the night lol. Having the fresh feeling in your mouth also makes me feel like I dont want to ruin it with eating.

Just heat them up with salt and other seasonings if you want and fill a big portion of your plate with that along with whatever else you're eating, at as many meals as possible. Or, you can often mix some into what you're cooking (a surprising amount of spinach can basically disappear into sauces, for example). 

Also, cutting out/reducing soda or other sweetened drinks is cheap and healthy if you drink them...you can replace them with unsweetened (or even lightly sweetened) tea, seltzer or just water.

People will say watch out for too much fruit and fruit juice, but that's all relative...lots and lots of fruit is way healthier than lots and lots of Doritos.","1_2"

Soup is also your friend. Canned if you have to - I know its not as healthy, but it beats Doritos by a LOT. If you have the time and energy, throw this together in a pot: a few tablespoons of better-than-bullion, a bag of frozen veggies, and whatever meat you have, all chopped up. Throw any other veggies you have in there that are still safe but getting a little soft. Just a few $, just a few minutes to throw it in (longer to cook), and its delicious and nutritious. Plus they say all the water content is good for weight loss.

I even toss in leftover spaghetti sauce if I have any.

Speaking of spaghetti, spaghetti squash is $1-2/lb in fall, and really good with a favorite spaghetti sauce or with butter, sugar, and cinnamon. It is ALL veggie except for what you add.

"CrystalStarshine",1,1,"How are things going for you? I hope you aren't getting discouraged. There was a lot of really good advice, so I'm going to agree with what others said: it's about preparation. 

Go to Aldi, or wherever you shop. Buy some chicken breast, a can of black beans, Greek yogurt, salsa, blueberries, apples, peanut butter, eggs, oatmeal, chia seed, almond milk, almonds (there are some nice flavored ones if you like). Probably around $55ish for that stuff.

Cut the chicken into smaller pieces, season it and bake, then store in your fridge. This will be a great dinner food anytime you aren't sure what to eat. When I'm completely lost I have a few oz of chicken breast with a 1/4 cup canned black beans, 1/4 c salsa, and 2 T Greek yogurt. Or have it with frozen veggies. Or make a healthy chicken salad with the Greek yogurt and some apple, celery and nuts.

Boil the eggs for an anytime snack - they're the best snack. Or scramble them for a last minute dinner.

Cut up the apple. Eat it with a tablespoon of peanut butter. Or toss it with cinnamon and bake it (air fryer is even better if you have one, but it's not necessary).

Mix up some overnight oats with chia seeds, almond milk, and mix ins (blueberries, peanut butter, almonds, a few mini chocolate chips) for quick easy breakfasts throughout the week. You can also make a pretty decent oat muffin with the milk, eggs and blueberries. I've been eating the ones I made sliced with a couple teaspoons of peanut butter.

Same deal with the chia seeds - mix a bunch of individual servings of chia pudding - chia seeds + almond milk or fruit juice. I also like them mixed in water.

I find a digital scale far more useful than measuring spoons and cups, but those will work in a pinch. The key is balancing preparation without getting bored. So one week I do blueberry overnight oats cold, the next I do cinnamon and apple overnight oats warmed up.","9"

"Zormac",0,0,"You should never go zero sugar unless under medical advisement, for example in case of diabetes.

One of the reasons we have a lot of sugar is literally because we love it and it's readily available. If you start reducing your sugar intake slowly, your palate will adapt and your will taste things with less sugar as if they were quite sweet. The same goes for salt.

If you want a solid place to start, increase your fiber intake. Fiber reduces sugar absorption in the intestine. Also, try to move away from soda/sweet tea, and favor drinking more water instead. This way, you'll still be able to get sugar from other sources. Sugar from drinks is more quickly absorbed by your body, so it's generally healthier to get it from foods instead of drinks.

Try reducing your carb intake a bit and get it from fruits and whole grains, drink more water, and have more fiber. Watermelon is a GREAT nutrient-dense fruit and a good source of energy without having to worry about added sugar. You'll see your sugar levels getting much manageable.","1"

This reduces the chance they will spoil because you'll buy fewer each time, you'll always have fresh food, and you have something new each week.

What crunchy healthy options are there? Let's try carrot sticks, asparagus or Pita bread chips. Chocolate milk is all you can drink try sugar free home mix versions. Save some $ and sugar.

 Keep trying 1 new food every set interval. 1 per meal might be too much so try 1 per day. And by ""try"" it needs to be at least 3 bites. Also don't try it 1 time.

"Zormac",4,4,"""Veggies"" are anything of plant origin, so beans absolutely count as veggies, as do leafy greens (lettuce, cabbage, kale, spinach, etc), roots (potatoes, carrots, cassava/manioc, etc), seeds, grains, etc. However, different veggies will offer different nutrients, so it's important to try to have variety each time. If you only focus on beans and onions, you'll be missing out on important vitamins and fiber.

Red bell peppers, broccoli, lentils, spinach, and carrots are amazing and very nutrient-dense. You don't need to eat all of them every time. You can alternate so you don't get sick of the flavor.

Also, one of the most important reasons to eat vegetables is fiber. You can get that from fruits too, as well as certain wheat-based foods. You can use whole grain wraps instead of regular tortillas.

For proteins and carbs I'd suggest doing a google search for something like 'macros for muscle gain' and looking at several sources to see what an average recommendation might be. Then you can try and meal plan to target those numbers.

  
For cooking, I understand where you're coming from and I have also been trying to learn to be more confident in the kitchen in the last couple of years. What worked for me was finding a couple of recipes that I liked and following them a few times, maybe making notes if you struggle with something or want it less salty, more sweet etc so you can do better next time.

  
The reason why that worked for me - I need really precise instructions in the kitchen, not like 'put the carrots in the oven until they look done' but more like 'this temperature, for this amount of time' exactly as I really had no idea what I was doing.

  
Second thing is that once you shop for the ingredients, and specifically the condiments for a couple of recipes, you build up a bit of a spices/condiments library which you can then use for other stuff. I hate bland fitness food and meal prep advice - plain chicken breast in the oven, plain steamed veg, white rice. It makes me feel super restricted and sad even if i'm not counting calories. So having a library of condiments available means it's now much easier to wing some meals that are super flavoursome with much less effort than before.

  
I love asian cuisine - japanese, vietamese, chinese, indian etc. It would be my first choice at a restaurant. So i found a couple of recipes that were easy and now i can make some of this stuff at home, within my calorie budget and feel so much happier when I eat and also super proud of myself for being able to cook something tasty. Makes me more keen to cook again and so it has a great feedback loop!

  
Take this recipe for example - [Chicken Katsu Curry](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/next-level-chicken-katsu-curry). I've had Katsu in restaurants and it was always a mystery. It turns out it's just veg with curry powder, miso, soy sauce, honey and a stock cube. I don't bother breading the chicken as it's too much effort for me personally, but I made the sauce twice now and I now remember kind of what goes in it and can make it without looking at the recipe. You slowly develop more confidence and ability to improvise over time which seemed impossible to me 1 year ago! It's super satisfying.

  
One website I really like is Pinch of Nom - it's got tasty satisfying food and loads of lower cal focused recipes so I feel kinda safe on there. I love this Chicken Jalfrezi and it's super easy to make : [recipe](https://pinchofnom.com/recipes/chicken-jalfrezi/)



I hope that's somewhat helpful - I mainly just want to extend some positive encouragement about cooking. I've been surprised that I can actually make yummy things I like, and also they're healthy, depending on which recipe you choose. I hope you can find some confidence and joy in the kitchen! Too often if we're watching what we eat, we end up making bland food and for me, that's made it 10x harder to stick to a weight loss plan.","2"
"auamethyst",2,2,"Well, exercising 1-2 hour a day is probably your problem. Its probably too much on your body, especially if youve had chronic illness. Over exercise can increase cortisol too high, which gives you a ravenous appetite. Cortisol is also catabolic, so building muscle in a high cortisol scenario is more difficult. You have to give your body ample time to recover to build muscle otherwise youre just spinning your wheels.

I would do this: strength training 3-4x per week for 45 Mins to an hour max. In between training days, work on low impact movement like your physical therapy and mobility exercises as well as things like walking, yoga, light swimming etc. 

Nutritionally, pay attention to protein as a priority. Youll have to figure out the amount that works, but protein is nearly impossible to over consume. Eat the protein first, and eat to satiety. Excessive hunger is usually caused by not eating enough protein. 
When you consistently get the amount of protein your body requires, your carbs and fats usually fall into place. 

When you eventually go into a cut and focus on weight loss - do not change the amount of protein you are eating. Reduce your fat or reduce your carbs, your choice. But for right now, aim to get your protein in and eat at maintenance or slightly above, you can build muscle and lose a little fat at the same time.","3"
"Salty_Piglet2629",2,2,"Have you used a smartwhatch to track your calory usage and are you tracking your intake?

It could be that you're under-eating for the level of exercise you do. A healthy deficit it 200-300 calories per day, and you'll be peckish all the time, but not massively hungry. 

It could also be that you're eating enough calories but not the right kinds. Eating more protein and can help against hunger. Things like boiled eggs and carrots can be an easy and healthy snack.
 
Also, don't forget that food is very psychological. If you have grown up with a carb-heavy junk-food diet it could be that your brain makes you feel hungry when you're eating healthy. The brain can make us think we haven't eaten just because we stop eating things it's used to. There are people who can't feel full unless they have fries because they were raised on fries. In Asia some people have this problem with white rice and in Europe it's bread. The common denominator is the food item is common and full of carbs with little nutrients. The brain seem to looooove those.","4"

I agree with the other response though that it helps to make stuff in bulk so at least you get a bunch of meals out of the effort. And there are ways to cut out steps in recipes as you become more experienced with cooking in general. Like you didn't necessarily have to cut the breasts into strips first and cook them in two separate pans. And you could just rub them with the taco seasoning first or marinate them so you don't have to do that step with the water.

Edit: And I forgot to say I assume Chipotle uses chicken thighs instead of breasts. Maybe that's why yours weren't tasting quite the same as theirs.","3"
"No_Reveal3451",-1,-1,"&gt; you didn't necessarily have to cut the breasts into strips first and cook them in two separate pans.

It's actually a time-saving measure.  The breasts cook faster this way since they are thinner and have effectively double their previous surface area. 

&gt; And you could just rub them with the taco seasoning first or marinate them so you don't have to do that step with the water.

This is actually the standard protocol when making taco meat.  It is an extra step, but I haven't found a way to make the chicken juicier or more seasoned than with the simmer step.  I wish that simply seasoning it first would do as good of a job. 

&gt; I've come to this same realization many times when cooking and it makes me understand how a lot of people fall into the trap of eating fast food garbage out of convenience.

100% this.  It's a huge convenience factor.  When you're not getting home from work and the grocery store until 7 or 8 PM, having to spend hours cooking and cleaning is not appealing.  It's so much easier and less energy-intensive to hit a fast food stop.","3_1"

Different varieties of lettuce have different textures which may improve the experience for you - I particularly like crunchy lettuce, like iceberg. Add extra greens to sandwiches, such as spinach, to get used to the flavor and texture. Try different types of extras in salad to see if it enhances your experience. For example, I love chopped apples in salad.

Also, see what kind of different dressings you like. I love olive oil with salt, and later started to appreciate balsamic vinegar. 

Little by little you'll start getting more used to it and learn the things you like more, and it becomes easier to try new things.","1"
"sunshinesandypants",1,1,"It takes about 10 days for your body and brain to start getting used to something. So like Zormac said, pick things you like and make them the basis of your salad. As a healthy eating coach, If you don't like too many salad ingredients I'd suggest adding ingredients into your existing food in subtle ways to make the texture more appealing, and then adding them into your salads. (eg, adding spinach into eggs, or lettuce into sandwiches, or grated carrots into pasta sauce). You'd be surprised at how quickly things become familiar to your taste buds! 

  
If you don't like cold salads, try warm ones! Start with a warm ingredient (eg. chicken, haloumi, chickpeas, egg) and build it out from there. There are sooo many different ways to go about it! If the aim is to add more vegetables into your food, try like a roasted vegetable salad - pumpkin, beetroot, chickpeas and carrots are great for using as the base ingredient. I love boiled eggs, so one of my favourites is egg salad, which is actually better warm. There's also an amazing corn and black bean salad with feta and chipotle which again is so yummy warm.

Salad's are pretty broad. Like...anything can be added really. There are salads with rice, bread, pasta, polenta, cous cous, and sooo many other things. You could choose 3-5 ingredients you really like, and combine them and experiment like that. 

In terms of salad dressings, I'm not a huge fan but I was vegetarian for years so really love the flavour of vegetables. One that I find really great is pickling onion slices in apple cider vinegar and adding them in, but olive oil, lemon and salt is apparently really nice too. 

Are there any particular textures or flavours you enjoy?

Also as a side note, olive garden is so cool, I've only been there once on holidays but seriously, how big are their salads! (not saying you have to go there or anything, but I always smile when I think about that place :D)

  
Anyway, hope this helps! I used to be in the same boat (like is salad really a meal?) but now I can't have meals without them. If it helps, you can message me if you want recipes, and I can link you to some that I make on a weekly basis.","2"

"Proper-Scallion-252",1,1,"I'd just start trying new options and add ins. 

For starters, try starting with spring mix over iceberg/romaine, I find that they provide more crunch than appeal in terms of flavor and texture. Then add in some protein source, I usually like chicken breast. Then pick a dressing, I urge you to start with dressing first because it sets the strongest flavor for the salad. Once you have the base of the salad (the greens and the protein) as well as the primary flavoring component, find some add-ins that bulk it out with more nutrients but compliment the dressing you've chosen!

For me, I love fruit, nuts and more tangy vinaigrettes. I would recommend trying a spring mix salad, with a serving of chicken breast (salt, pepper, and some herb that pairs well with your flavors, usually thyme works well with this combo), and then pick a nut, a fruit and a cheese. Here are some combos I love:

* Blueberries, almonds and goat cheese
* Strawberries, pecans and goat cheese
* Apples, walnuts and goat cheese
* Craisins, walnuts and goat cheese (I'm a whore for a good fresh goat cheese)
* Orange slices, walnuts, and (surprise) goat cheese.

I like to use a homemade lemon vinaigrette as a dressing, that way I control the sugar content, and you can always swap out the fruit for any fresh or dried fruit you like, any nut you like, and any cheese you like. It's a super simple formula!

I also recommend a fall kale salad I found that uses apple chunks, roasted sweet potato, chicken and pecans, which is dressed with a tahini and maple syrup dressing that is just freaking awesome.

Surprisingly to me, the thing that helps me the most is exercise. 30 minutes of something vigorous 3x per week seems to be the sweet spot to me. I was recently laid up for a while and couldn't exercise, and though my diet didn't change much, my cholesterol numbers really spiked. 

So I keep mine \*closer\* to good by that exercise, oats in the mornings, lots of good fiber, using meat as a ""condiment"" instead of the main thing on the plate, and the supplements red yeast rice+CoQ10.

In the last 2 weeks for breakfast, Ive been doing things like overnight oats with almond milk and protein powder, protein shakes with almond milk and fresh fruit, wheat toast with avocado spread/spinach/egg, hummus/roasted tomatoes or peanut butter/banana/honey/oats.

For lunch, Ive been doing spinach salads with strawberry, almonds, mandarin oranges, cranberries (I might cut those out because I think theyre more high and sugar and not as good for me as I thought they were) and raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Or a Caesar salad. If Im still hungry as a snack, Ive been doing cottage cheese or Greek yogurt. Someone gave me an idea to try making a little pizza with whole wheat tortillas, low sodium tomato sauce and fat-free mozzarella cheese for lunch so I might try that next week. Im finding it tough to eat a salad every day. 

For dinner, weve been doing a couple different things,  trying to mostly do a protein, starch and vegetable. One night might be salmon, brown rice, and broccoli. One night chicken and potatoes and corn on cob. One night tilapia, brown rice and asparagus. One night did a stir fry with chicken, veggies and rice noodles. Yesterday I made stuffed peppers using ground turkey, brown rice, black beans, and corn. Trying to keep a variety.

My drinks are probably something I need to improve a little bit, Ive never been much of a water person, Im trying to drink more. But Im also drinking light cranberry juice or green tea. And Ive been giving myself one glass of a drink of my choosing at night time. One night it might be an iced tea, one night lemonade, etc. I know not ideal, but trying to keep in moderation. 

I feel like I dont wanna go to extreme hard-core, especially to start or I fear I will get tired of it and not stick to it. But I dont want to be so lazy with it all that it makes no difference.

""Who would be more likely to die, the one drinking mainly coffee, or the one drinking mainly tea?""

What you said are insignificant to overeating. Even if you aren't american, you still have everyday, everywhere products which contain:
MSG and other flavour enchancers, a main reason for overeating and cravings
Artificial sweeteners, which tricks the brain into thinking it got energy, and then craves for it
Trans and saturated fats
And, most horrible of all, simple sugar.

You said 80% wholefoods, so the rest 20% may destroy, in case of bad things added, your control of apetite.

Sugar addiction has almost no difference to drug addiction. Simple sugar absorbs instantly, gives no benefit or use to the body and has 9 different disavantages (or things it makes worse): heart disease, high blood pressure, chronic inflamation, loss of apetite control, depression, cognitive decline, fatty liver disease, dental decay and acne.

https://youtu.be/HHe50x6W2nY?si=S-oihZiJ9UWBy7Jp

If you want to eat less, try sorghum (/sorghum porridge), casein and chia seeds. Lots of chia seeds.

Also, overeating often is associated with mental decline, lack of concentration and other control problems. Be VERY mindful about your omega-3 intake, and its ratio to omega 6.

For concentration and/or diabetes and sugar addiction, which causes overeating and puts you in a vicious circle which creates lots of stress, also get ashwaganda.

Honey is still processed as simple sugar, it is considered healthier because of bioactive compounds and anti-oxidants. If needed to add sugar, add honey, but anyone wanting to see how much they can control themselves, try to limit your simple sugar intake to nearly 0, and see how good you can do then.

Foods like nuts and milk which contain sugar are naturally good ratio'd with other good macros, so they don't create as much craving.

No matter your type of diet, whatever has more simple sugars and other craving inducing things will always be the diet that makes you overeat, and people often don't read the ingredients or label. Big factor too would be the one containing more fiber and protein, so whatever diet has more of those will be a big factor for the diet.

Rather than being Plato's caveman, seeing only some shadows while being restrained and thinking overeating is about some kind of easily-named and defined type of diet, be mindful about the specific ingredients you eat, and what you lack, not only your macros and whether you eat mostly plants or not.

Bonus: protein quality is stupidly important too, search DIAAS for this.

But I would still recommend roughly counting calories. What I do is have standard meal sizes e.g. one bowl of rice, 2 sandwiches with a certain amount of cheese etc, that are all roughly the same calories.

"Environmental-Food36",1,1,"If you don't have peanut allergy, abuse it as much as you can.
Simple, clean peanut butter, with nothing added.

I have peanut allergy so I needed to switch the nut butter, but the peanut was the best money-wise and taste too.

For bulking, I drink daily a shake of 300ml milk, 50-100g porridge of oats or sorghum, 100g of different nut butters and 50g of whey protein/casein. It works, though I don't fully have the discipline to drink it daily.

Don't ruin your diet, energy and mood by drinking lot of simple sugars or junk food. Milk, nuts and nut butters already have naturally simple sugars of which all have a good ratio.

Honey, though it's better because of antioxidants and bioactive compounds, it's still made of simple, and not complex sugars. If you ever have to add sugar, add honey because it is healthier, but do not abuse it.

The only thing I can think of about you being an ironworker, is that you would need to snack during work. Nuts. Lots of nuts, filled with protein, fats, very portable, no need to cook. Peanuts have good taste and the most cheap out of them. Also bananas are good for bulking and highly portable, but please don't use them in a shake, you'll ruin a lot of its properties.

If you care much about this, try HMB as supplement. When doing a lot of work, the energy will be taken from muscle mass too, HMB can prevent this, especially at extreme effort, and sometimes have better effect than steroids on muscle. (+creatine would be a very good, non-steroid combo)

Look at my post to see my diet and journey of bulking, cause' I felt horrible bulking for some time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/s/LBvlcOZaui

I found porridge and nut butter as the best sources of complex carbs and heatlhy fats, you can find other too.
If you want to bulk to slightly increase body fat, you don't need to emphasize on protein intake as much as I do. 
Bonus meals, either for protein either for complex carbs: anything potato related, if they are made with a healthy cooking oil, even french fries are healthy; beans; lentils; eggs; fatty fish; and you can search for more.

Gainer supplements may do the work, but please check the label for sugar. Don't get one with more than 15g of simple sugar per day, and if it has a lot look at the portion amount and simple sugar per calorie ratio.

Oh, and calculate your BMI, if you already have a good BMI it is not necesarry to bulk that hard, rather you can do it slowly.

Also, be careful no matter your diet about omega 3 amount and with omega 6 ratio. I highly recommend omega-3 supplements if you don't have acces to fatty fish.","3"

"sunshinesandypants",2,2,"As a pharmacist and healthy eating nutrition coach, I have a few strategies that could help

  
1. Keep repeating a mantra to yourself anytime you come across sugar. Sounds woo, I know, but if you can choose something like ""sugar is poisonous for my body"", or ""sugar is causing so much inflammation in my body"" or even focus on some of the side effects you get - eg. ""sugar makes my stomach hurt so much"" or ""Sugar makes me crash so badly"" - and accompany those words with an image (I personally use a spiky virus ball and picture it tearing through my veins and arteries) it can really reduce the excitement and desire for sugar, because you're changing the association of sugar with fun to sugar as something that's harming you

  
2. High healthy fat snacks are really great for getting rid of sugar cravings. Avocado, cottage cheese, peanut butter, yoghurt and nuts in general are super good for this. Anytime you have a sugar craving, have one of these instead, wait 10 minutes and if you still have the sugar craving, i'd suggest eating it but in a way smaller portion. 

  
3. As part of #2, while you're waiting the 10 minutes, maybe explore if something is causing the sugar craving? boredom, a surge of emotion and because you can see it are really common causes, but obviously each person has a different cause. 

  
4. I agree that using natural substitutes is super effective. Fruit is a great one, and tbh, if you're still in a place where you get sugar cravings, you can eat as much fruit as you like, because it's not just giving you sweetness, they're full of fibre, nutrients and water

But really, you have to treat your body's cravings like a spoiled, obnoxious 2-year-old who is screaming for sweets all day long. Be patient. Stop and breathe. Eat something else.","7"
"notreallylucy",3,3,"I buy Viter Energy mints on Amazon. They have 40mg of caffeine and some B vitamins. A cup of drip coffee has about 100 mg of caffeine, so it's not some enormous dose of caffeine, you can manage it easily.

I read a study that a breakfast high in protein creates as much alertness as a cup of coffee. I've tested it out and feel this is true of me, so I make sure I get protein at breakfast. A lot of typical American breakfast foods are low in protein.

And of course, the best way to be alert is to get a good night's sleep. I notice a decrease in my alertness and attention span when I get less than 7 hours of sleep. I know that's easier said than done, but as much as you can, prioritize quality sleep.","1"

To ease that transition, try decaf or low acid tea. Water it down further you go then phase it out.

"mistymorning789",2,2,"This is an excellent question. I've been asking myself the same question, for years! I'm currently experimenting with the Longevity Diet, developed by Valter Longo. But, I think there is evidence that people can be healthy on a variety of diets, but what is the healthiest for you? Personally and this is my opinion, cutting out highly processed foods as much as possible or entirely is a good start. Like the diet soda is probably not healthy. but how often and how much you drink it and what to drink in its place, I don't know? green tea, filtered water with lemon? Seltzer water? For me diet soda is addictive, so I have a really hard time just having it just sometimes (I love Diet Coke, but try to drink polar seltzer instead). but maybe for you it's something you could have once in a while?

as for the red meat, vegetarian, keto, vegan, Whole Foods, paleo, low carb, Mediterranean diet, carnivore... what's the healthiest? My OPINION, little to no added sugar, meat sometimes in moderate portions (depending on your activity level, age, health status) you decide. Fish is usually healthier than red meat, but some fish have a lot of contaminants, or are too expensive. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. whole grains instead of refined grains. Carbs in moderation. like some people eat a lot of pasta, bread, sugary sweets and processed fast food, that would be unhealthy. changing to a lot of fruits and vegetables and lean meats would be healthier. 

If you are having trouble on where to start, cut back on sugar and refined carbohydrates foods (white breads, pasta, cake cookies... ) and add in a little more any natural whole food you enjoy, nuts, seeds, even unprocessed meat. See how it works.

reread your post. The new onset of lower energy than normal is hard to know, but could be a vitamin is low. for me I had very low iron and undiagnosed for a long time, but that's not as common in men. Also a vitamin D supplement helps a lot of people. check your vitamin levels to make sure nothing is low.","1"
"fattygoeslim",1,1,"For me

1. To eat healthy means it has to be sustainable and long term. Cutting out all ""junk"" (read less nutrious) food isn't sustainable for me, nor is it for most people. 

2. No sweeteners are harmful, all that came about is someone massively reading a study wrong and idiots running with it. You would need to drink a massive amount in a day to get near enough sweeteners to cause any damage and honestly that is such a tall order no one has managed it, it's something like 40+ 330ml cans a day. 
 Drink your sugar free drinks. The water part is because we need water and propepr hydration in order to function and help your organs work properly. In the uk it's recommended to drink 1.5-2.5L of water a day.

3. You don't need to cut out anything other then foods you are allergic to, don't like, or have to give up for medical reasons (like certain foods that react with medication).


These are my tips for a healthy sustainable diet

You should never eat below your bmr and you should eat below your maintenance.

Food and drink.

1. Only give up foods you don't like, are allergic to or have gone off. There is no need to give up anything else unless it's absolutely medically necessary and your doctor has said to. 

2. Make sure you have a minimum of t portions of fruit and vegetables a day, one portion is 80g. Have a variety, so 5 different fruits and vegetables. Beans count, potatoes and grains don't. 

3. Make sure you are getting a minimum of 25g of fiber a day, eating lots of fruits and vegetables will help. 

4. Protein, keep this high, at least a minimum of 80g a day, the more the better. Have a mix of animal and plant protein too as the amino acids are what you need.

5. Healthy fats. These are essential and you need a minimum of 40g a day for health. 

6. You can still have take aways/fast food, just make better swaps or half it and save the rest for another day. I can make an 8slice pizza last 3 days, as I have it with a huge chickpea and green salad. 

7. Like fizzy drinks? Swap for the sugar free/zero kind. 

8. Get a water bottle to refill and drink at least 2 litres of water a day. 

9. Play around with herbs and spices, lower your salt if you eat a lot of it. 

10. Try one new recipe a week.

Exercise. 

1. If you can move more then do so. 

2. Every 50min you are sat down, stand up and stretch and walk around for at least 10mins. 

3. Do morning and evening stretches, this helps with getting you set up for the day/night. Look up morning and bedtime yoga/stretches. 

4. A 20min walk each day helps massively 

Medical. 

1. Get your bloods checked, nutrition levels, hormone levels like thyroid blood glucose ect, liver and kidney function. This will help you and your Dr monitor if you need to change your diet plan.

2. Only take supplements if you've been told to by your doctor after a blood test. A multivitamin is crap.","2"
"LegendaryReader",1,1,"I haven't found conclusive proof it's bad for you. However, it could be proven in like 20 years that it was bad.   
Either way, if you don't wanna do a tons upons tons of research, here's my tip. Eat a varied and balanced diet. Don't eat one sort of meat everyday, mix everything up. Mix ur veggies, some days it could be broccolis, peas and carrots. Another day smth else. Red meat, chicken, fish and vegan protein sources. Just eat various stuff and you should be good. Not rice everyday, you could eat rice one day, pasta another, then lentils or potatoes. 

Do you get what I'm saying? As for what to drink, it should usually be mostly water, but you can drink tea without caffeine in it, I drink about 1 liter of tea a day. If you don't like water, you could drink random stuff like fruits mixed with water or milk. How about you try carbonated water? There is a lot of stuff. You can even make soup.","3"

"mistymorning789",1,1,"I kind of agree with you in theory. Maybe when I was younger I could manage moderation  and treat myself occasionally without having to think about it. but I now have some health issues so sticking with a healthy diet has become more of an issue for me. I am thinking of giving myself a cheat day or cheat meal, to take some of the pressure off, so I can stick with a healthy diet most of the time. Also, I know I'm struggling with breaking habits from a lifetime. So, I think I have to kind of go through a kind of withdrawal period before I feel like I can control my eating enough. My biggest problem is the foods that I would like to avoid so that I can be healthy and lose weight are pretty much everywhere! And they are also kind of pushed on me, I have to keep saying no and it's just hard.

"[deleted]",36,36,"Fucking absolutely. Dont ever let anyone tell you otherwise.  Heres what it will take and the benefits:

1. Consistency and Commitment:  Being fit is all about making it a core part of your life. You workout every day you can. You are active every single day. You eat healthy (this will be a part of your new lifestyle), but you make sure to enjoy some treats 1 or 2 days a week. You dont have to give to everything you love, but you will have to build new habits.  

2. Motivation: You need to have something that lights a fire under your ass. Whatever that is is up to you. Someone said something to you that really hurt you?  Use that as your fire. Put that quote on your fucking wall and think about it every day. Prove that person wrong.  Whatever it is, youre going to need a burning desire to make change. Without 100% commitment and drive to change and a willingness to leave your comfort zone, it wont happen. 

3. Method / instruction: It may be difficult for you to self motivate, or gain knowledge sufficient to workout on your own to start. This will change as you gather experience / knowledge / strength. You will probably want to look into group workout classes to start. As you start to go to your classes daily (because youre committed, and you are going to accomplish your goal NO MATTER WHAT) you will gain knowledge on how to workout, and your own body and its strengths and weaknesses. You will also make friends at the gym!  Its amazing. 

4. Confidence: You will probably feel insecure at the gym, almost everyone does at the start. Thats normal. Embrace it. Most people at the gym are not judgemental, they will be much more likely to look at you and think good for her for working out as opposed to something negative. People at good gyms are all working towards a common goal: bettering themselves. Ignore any hate, power through it. Youre not special, everyones journey starts somewhere and you will have to have the confidence to move forward and set aside any insecurities. 

5. THE GOOD STUFF: Ok a lot of that was probably pretty scary now let me tell you about all the amazing things you will experience. 

Short term: The first 2-3 weeks will be tough. This is where you need to be resilient and commit to going and changing. After you get through those first couple weeks you will notice amazing things happening. You will have more energy. You will be less tired. You will have more positive thoughts in your head and more just for life. The psychological benefits of working out are EVERYTHING. 

Mid Term: After 3 months of working out consistently, you will have a moment where you look at yourself in the mirror and be like holy shit& its working. Its an amazing feeling. Amazing. It will put a smile on your face and throw more fuel on that burning fire to change for the better. If you can make it to the 3 month mark consistently, I believe youre on your way to a completely different life that will bring more confidence, joy, happiness, and an increased feeling of self worth. This is why we all workout. For that feeling of being proud of yourself and following through with the commitment we made to ourselves. 

Long term: The world is your oyster. Once you make working out and exercising a core part of your life, everything changes. You can do whatever you want with it. Play new sports, be a bikini model, be a power lifter, master a discipline and teach it to others random examples but you know what Im saying. You will have confidence and belief in yourself to do things youve never thought possible. Fitness will truly unlock positive thoughts in your brain that you never knew were there.  

I have no idea why I decided to write this to a stranger on the internet, I guess I just want other people to be happy. I think fitness is a core part of personal happiness and gratification. I hope this inspires to start the journey.  Find that fire that motivates you.

"IAmSomewhatDamaged",3,3,"This is amazing advice and you hit pretty much all the bases.  The most important thing is CONSISTENCY.  Its very easy to get motivated at times and feel like you are absolutely going to be dedicated to working out consistently&. But then you have a bad day at work (or whatever).  OR you dont get good sleep one night and you feel too tired to work out.  This is when it gets HARD to stay consistent.  
  
There are days that my workouts are absolute bare minimum (on those hard days).  But I STILL got my workout in to at least keep pace with my goals.  Its OKAY to have a bad workout once in awhile.  Its also okay to take a couple days off, but try not to go any longer than a week (absolute max) without working out because after that, its MUCH easier to fall off and just quit altogether.  Maybe start 3 days a week, then progress to 4-5 days a week as your body adjusts.
  
OP of this post, start slow.  You dont HAVE to run 5 miles to get benefits.  If running is hard, start by just going for a walk every day.  Stay consistent with that each day, then you will be able to slowly progress over time.  Just make sure youre pushing yourself&. You should be tired and breathing hard at the end of your workout.

And for me, one of the most important things was making sure that I enjoyed what I was eating. I was feeling satisfied with my meals, and not denying myself the things I really loved.

I gave up cold turkey with small exceptions. I really like Coke. The exception I allow myself is that I get a coke when I go to the cinema. Popcorn and coke at the cinema is such an incredible treat. I don't go often so when I do, I indulge. 

The other thing we did was stop having it in the house. My partner was drinking San Pellegrino soda and buying six packs. He switched to sparkling water and now neither of us miss it. So we don't have any in the house. 

I also learned that I was drinking it because I was super dehydrated. It always quenched my thirst more than water. But once I started drinking more water, I didn't get that ""I'm so thirsty I could die"" feeling that led to me drinking soda.

Id have an indulgence day and feel I threw however long Id been off it right out the window. 

I also dont keep soda in the house but it wont stop me from going to a gas station for a fountain drink. Especially with all these damn rewards programs that make it free.  Ive been solid on my no and yea days so far. I started with every other day. Now on the once every 3 days.

"expiredassspoon",2,2,"I'm happy you're trying to eat healthier! I do have a few tips.

1-try to always include all food groups in your meals, protein, complex carb, veg and optionally fruit, and a source of healthy fat. Breakfast didn't have a good source of protein, so I would recommend adding maybe some plain Greek yogurt on the side, and instead of spreading butter, you could swap that for olive oil or mashed avocado! Also, ideally choose a whole grain bagel for some feel-good fiber. 

2- it would be great to see a little more fresh fruits and veggies. orange juice, though not bad for you in moderation, has most of the fiber and a lot of the nutrition removed from the orange. so orange juice, even natural brands, doesn't count as a fruit serving. So I'd recommend eating a whole orange instead for some more nutrients, and in general, try to add a little more fresh veggies if you can, like some spinach and tomato slices on your toastie, with carrots on the side, and adding a side salad to dinner!

3-Opt for good quality complex carbs and whole grains, while it's great you're choosing baked crisps instead of fried, it would be great to see some more elements of the potato, so you could try roasting them with some herbs and olive oil. But you seem to be mostly choosing great options which is great!

4-try to opt for healthy unsaturated fat instead of butter, since it's mostly saturated fat.(you don't have to cut butter out though, everything in moderation!) olive oil and avocado oil are great cooking oils to use, and nuts, seeds and avocado are amazing sources of healthy fats! Look for monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fats, those are the good kind.

So far you seem to be on a good path! Good luck on eating healthier!","3"

"IssyGE",1,1,"If you want some good advice on healthy eating and the rest of it, I would highly recommend the ZOE podcasts and find an episode related to how to eat a healthy and balanced diet. 
They are very interesting and informative podcasts that are all scientifically backed. 
Just giving a listen to a couple could help get you on the right tracks. 
I listen to the podcasts on Spotify, but I believe you can get them on some other platforms too. 

From what I can see in your meal plan, I would recommend including more vegetables in each meal and more protein too. Instead of a glass of orange juice, you could try having a glass of milk (or a substitute),  or coffee or tea( without added sugar/sweetner) .

Try to reduce your intake of ultraprocessed food wherever you can, which would include things like crisps, sweets , sweet chocolates, and some shop-bought sliced breads (likely bagels). Again, to understand what is considered ultrproocessed, you can research this or seek out a podcast. But the general rule is: if a product contains a long list of ingredients,many of which you have never heard of, it is likely ultrprocessed and should be avoided where possible.

If you have the time, you could also try looking up some healthy, whole foods recipes, where you can have fun and experiment with new favours, and try something new. I have found it takes a while to find out what you really gel with, but when you understand what makes you feel good, and what doesn't, you are on the road already!

Pizza is a physically small slice with alot of calories where as somthing with less calories or more fiber can fill you up faster or allow you to eat more. For example, try to think about it like this for 100 calories. You can have like 2 bites of pizza or 33 spears of asparagus. Which one is gonna fill you up? Actually putting these things side by side btw really puts into perspective the realtive caloric values of food. If you compare foods like pizza to healthier options you just get less food for more calories and often foods high in salt sugar and fat can make you eat more than you otherwise would bc nature sees those as resources not health risks. It even helps me pick the lesser of two evils like a can of soda is about the same sugar as 3 cookies so i buy 2 cookies and im still doing better than if i drank the soda.

The concern with smoothies is sugar, calories and additional consumption. You're still getting a ton of vitamins and minerals, but be sure to make your smoothies healthy and understand that everything is okay in moderation. So a smoothie consisting of fruits, unsweetened yogurt, milk, etc. 

What you're worried about with frequent consumption of smoothies is added sugar (and naturally high sugar levels from the fruit, but imo I don't see that as too much of an issue seeing as it's natural), they're typically higher in calories if you're not careful about what you're adding (like nut butters, sweeteners, etc), and because a blender breaks up the structure of the fruit, it won't have the same satiety of whole fruit so you may be hungry sooner and then end up consuming a calorie heavy smoothie followed by more additional food.

My recommendation would be to add whole fruit, fat free greek yogurt, lowfat milk for consistency, unsweetened flavoring components like cocoa powder or vanilla extract, and healthy amounts of nut butters or other flavorings. To add more sustenance to smoothies you could look into adding oats and/or protein powders to make it a bit more substantial.","1"
"[deleted]",3,3,"I think its especially healthy if youre otherwise not inclined to eat the healthy smoothie ingredients.

One of them doesnt eat much veggies otherwise so I think its pretty healthy in his case. The others I prefer they just eat the whole foods (plus less work for me >#). None would eat a ton of spinach otherwise, just as greens on a sandwich. 

Side question- I know many people will peel apples for smoothies. I cant think of the reason why. A lot of the fiber and nutrition is concentrated in the peel plus you cant really tell its there once blended. I just wash it really well and usually get organic too.

There have been studies done on the topic but I'm currently at work so don't have time to go look for them. As with anything scientific, there is no conclusive understanding of the topic but overall I think the concept of processing of any kind having an effect on the bioavailability of nutrients in food is broadly agreed upon.

Had a chat with my doctor about this today (lol coincidence) and he mentioned that if the fibers are chopped up smaller, then perhaps from a gut health perspective it won't act in the same way to give bulk to your shit in the GI tract, but that he doesn't think the insulin response will change significantly.","6_2_1_2_2_1"

"Elysiumthistime",3,3,"Hi, I struggle with a very similar thing. For me, my mood dictates my appetite. So when I'm feeling low/depressed, I lose my appetite and can go days eating next to nothing. But when I'm anxious/stressed I can't eat enough, I will binge to a point where I feel physically ill and even if my stomach is in bad shape the next day, I'll continue to gorge.

Recognising the pattern is the first step. Being self aware of your actions is the only way you can begin to change. After that, you'll need to find a healthier way to regulate your mood. So when I feel stressed, I will go for a walk, go for a swim, journal, go take a bath, meditate etc. find whatever works for you. 

Therapy is a great option if you can afford it but you'll need to research carefully before choosing a therapist. I've had some bad experiences with ones I've opened up to in the past and it really put me off therapy, she essentially started asking me for tips on how I keep so lean (after I told her I was depressed and starving myself as a result). 

Lastly, I have found some great results in removing ultra processed foods from my house. This worked for me because these were the foods I was turning to when I felt the need to eat my stress, so by removing them, I was forced to face my emotions head on. So take an honest look at your ownpatterns and see if you can find a way to set your home environment up for success.

I know its so much easier said than done but dont give up!

3. Limit snacking so they are hungry for balanced meals. 


4. They must at least really try the family meal rather than get to choose something like macaroni and cheese if they think they might not like it. The alternative if they really can't eat a family dinner (too spicy for instance) shouldn't be so unhealthy that it's always more appealing than a healthy meal. 


5. If toddlers are exposed to a variety of healthy foods, they often better know their nutritional needs. If they say they aren't hungry, don't make them eat. If they only want meat one day, then fruit the next, ok.

We also teach that all food is good food, but good for different reasons. The foods I listed above we tell them are good for our bodies, and we need those to fuel our bodies and grow. We teach that candy is good too, but that its good for our mental health, it makes us happy to enjoy it.

We eat meals as a family at the dinner table and encourage trying new things in different ways. Ex: made salmon for dinner, kid doesnt like it, we ask what they liked and dont like, then suggest it possible they dont like how we cooked it. We cook it a different way next time and have kids try again. Sometimes its all about how its made. My kids dont like cauliflower in stir fry but enjoy it steamed with a little salt and pepper. 

We recently started letting the kids help us cook and plan meals, and noticed that getting them involved with making dinner encourages them to eat whats made.

It sounds like your body is craving sugar for a reason and you're liking having trouble losing control after you do cave to one craving and then want more and more because of how much your body is needing sugar. Your brain runs off sugar. Sugar is part of a balanced diet.

Knowing that, you can't decide what works best for you. Can you lead a healthy enough lifestyle to balance out all those egg yolks, enabling you to have their benefits, or do you need to limit and do damage control by having little to none at all? If you skip the yolk, what do you replace it with or miss out on? Consider the health (and potentially social) swap if you skip the yolk.

Most fast food places have at least one decent option (like the chili at Wendy's), and you can just go when you really want to see your friends.

"Proper-Scallion-252",2,2,"I would definitely consult a doctor with regards to your diet and exercise given your diagnosis, but adding lean protein sources where you can is a good start and if that isn't enough you can always look to protein supplements! I like to add a half scoop of protein powder to overnight oats, or use powder in baked oatmeal! That way you're adding a good deal of protein into an otherwise low protein meal! Fair warning though, I've found that adding it to standard oatmeal (the heated kind) tends to result in a bad, grainy texture. Maybe it's just the brand I buy or maybe it's something to do with the heat, I'm not sure!

Another thing to note is that at your height and weight, if you follow a recommended .8g per lb rule, you're looking to hit 97g or so a day. 

Two eggs are about 14g, nonfat Greek yogurt (depending on serving size and brand) is about 18g, a serving of nuts (depending on type and quantity) is about 7g, a 4 ounce serving of chicken breast nets you about 35g which leaves you needing about 23g for dinner which is completely achievable with a small serving of meat or high protein base! You're likely already getting enough protein each day, as I didn't add up the small amounts of protein throughout the rest of your food like the oats, potentially milk in your oatmeal, pasta, etc. 

A lot of people think they need to load up on a metric shit ton of protein, but studies actually show the benefit of protein intake falls off around .8g/lb of body weight. After that, it might be useful, or it might just be a waste depending on your training and body.

Take the lesson from yesterday and maybe don't go as wild as you did yesterday, but seek to find a level where you are gaining weight but you are not stuffing yourself so much that you feel bad the following day. Find a level that feels good to you and that allows you to enjoy life.

Remember that gaining weight is just like losing weight. For losing weight the calorie deficit should not be so big that you feel like you are starving. It will feel bad and you will likely lose weight faster than what is healthy. The same goes for gaining weight. The calorie surplus should not be so large that you're a walking stuffed turkey or feel a stomach ache the next day as might make you gain weight faster than what is healthy. Going to the extremes only to then fall back the next day because you feel sick might also lead to yoyo'ing.

"BeeAtTheBeach",1,1,"For the most part (like unless you have a health issue) I wouldn't worry too much about dietary cholesterol and focus on limiting saturated fats to under 10% of your daily calorie intake. You can look for a TEE calculator to get an idea of who many calories you need, then up that by about 500 a day and you should gain a pound a week.

If you feel like you get too much fat from time to time, you can make up for it (sort of) with more fiber the next day. Especially soluble fiber (beans, potatoes, veggies) since it slows the body's absorption of fat, plus fiber is all kinds of good for you anyway. \*EDIT: If you're not used to eating a lot of fiber, you need to increase that slowly as to not cause digestive issues\*

I'd try getting more quality calories not just high calories. Lean protein (like eggs and poultry), healthy fats (nuts/seeds, avocado, low-fat dairy, etc), fruits and veggies, whole grains, beans, etc. Since you're not worried about losing, just eat as much as you want and get on a schedule to eat a little something every few hours.

You would do well by working to meet your nutrient (protein, calcium, fiber, potassium, etc) needs and keep an eye on your sodium and sugar intake as well. Maybe charting your diet might help.

"kalari-",1,1,"What does your eating look like now? Doc says protein supp. Is that because you're not eating enough of it, or do you need more than average? Do you have a protein goal?

Seitan is pretty much pure wheat protein (15-20g per 5oz serving), peas are what make pea protein powder but with fiber and a bit of carbs that make it more digestible (9g per cup, honestly kind of low for a legume), nutritional yeast has about 5g protein per tablespoon if you throw it on your food (tasty with peas - 2tbsp nooch on a cup of peas with butter, salt, and pepper gets you). Chia seeds are a good add-in to things as well, 5g per 2 tbsp. Soy beans and edamame have about 18g per cup, black and Pinto beans, and lentils have about 15g per cup.

2 serving as above gets you close to about 30-40g  protein, other things fill in some (4g per cup cooked rice, 6g per cup cooked oatmeal, 8g per cup cooked quinoa...) to get to 50 or 60g pretty easily with 2 or 3 servings. If you need more than that, protein balls or bars, as mentioned, can boost you.

So, like a sample day could be:

Breakfast: 1 cup oatmeal with 2 tbsp chia seeds and fruit

Lunch: 1 cup quinoa with 1 cup peas, 2 tbsp nutritional yeast, hot sauce, soy sauce

Dinner: 1 cup brown rice, 5oz BBQ seitan, 1 cup steamed broccoli

Adds up to about 60g protein, which is typically enough for a 150lb person. Add another 10-20 with one of those snack things.

In general, we eat a lot of seitan, tofu and beans/rice. I don't like protein powder as a drink, but I do use some protein powders in my cooking -- naked pea and naked rice are good options if you want to mix it into things like soups. If you want to sweeten oatmeal, you can use a protein powder for that. Those are some options for protein powder that aren't just smoothies/drinks in case you don't like the sweetness, or just don't like the texture of protein powder drinks. 

I know a lot of vegetarians like eggs for protein. We do tofu scramble in our house, and my kids generally like it.

For example, pureeing a bunch of cooked veg can make great sauce. Or, if you don't like the flavor of some veggies, a small amount of pureed veggies can be added to an otherwise strongly flavored sauce (like tomato or Bolognese) where the pureed vegetables just kinda disappear into the sauce and are never noticeable. I do this with winter squash and eggplant, and nobody would even know they're in there. 

If you like crunchy, you can do tempura vegetables. Not the healthiest given the fat, but it's a step into the more veggies direction. Or eat them raw, with a dip. 

You can also add veggies to home made meatballs. Canned beans and chopped peppers go in there really well and for the most part don't affect the texture too much.

Egg-based meals: Scrambled eggs with avocado, smoked salmon, or saut√©ed veggies. Add whole-grain toast for extra fiber.

Tofu scramble: Similar to scrambled eggs, but made with crumbled tofu, turmeric, and veggies.

Chia seed pudding: Made with almond or coconut milk, chia seeds, and fruit. Add nut butter for extra calories and satiety.

Smoothie with protein &amp; healthy fats: Blend banana, almond butter, spinach, protein powder, and unsweetened plant milk.


2. Whole-Grain &amp; Fiber-Rich Options

Quinoa breakfast bowl: Cooked quinoa with nuts, seeds, and fruit for a fiber-rich, protein-packed start.

Whole-wheat toast with toppings: Try nut butter &amp; banana, hummus &amp; avocado, or almond butter &amp; chia seeds.

Sweet potato hash: Roasted sweet potatoes with eggs, beans, or avocado for a nutrient-dense meal.


3. Savory Breakfasts for Sustained Fullness

Breakfast burrito: Whole wheat wrap with scrambled eggs (or tofu), black beans, avocado, and salsa.

Leftover dinner-style breakfast: Stir-fried veggies with brown rice or quinoa and an egg on top.

Since youve had high cholesterol since your teens, genetics might be a big part of it. A doctor or dietitian can help fine-tune your plan. They might also suggest medication or check for other health factors.

For meals, things like lentil soups, roasted veggies with grains, salmon with greens, or even pasta with lots of veggies and olive oil could all be heart-friendly options.","1"

\-Dandelion

"LiefFriel",2,2,"Some simple classics for me:

Overnight oats:  
\- 1/2 cup of rolled oats  
\- 1/2 cup yogurt (stick to plain nonfat to keep sugar down)  
\- 1-2 tablespoons of peanut or almond butter  
\- 1 tablespoon of cocoa nibs (or extra dark chocolate)  
\- 1/2 cup of fruit of your choice (berries tend to work best)  
\- 1 tablespoon of chia or flax seed (crush it or run it through a food processor to break it up some before using it)  
\- 1/4 cup almond milk (or milk of choice)

Put it all together before bed and enjoy for breakfast. You can add sugar (I'd use a little honey) but I try to keep it down. You can try different extracts with this and mix it up too (vanilla and almond would be good for this but I wouldn't use mint without taking the peanut butter out).

Calabrian Pasta:  
\- 3 cups of chickpea pasta (cooked)  
\- 1 jar of roasted red peppers (or two large red bell peppers), chopped  
\- 1/2 yellow onion or 1 shallot, chopped  
\- 4 cloves of garlic (or more if you love it), minced  
\- 1 tablespoon olive oil  
\- 6 ounches of Ricotta OR tofu (firm or silken)  
\- 1/4 Parmesan  
\- 6 or 7 fresh basil leaves  
\- 1/2 tspn oregano, paprika and salt

Cook the pasta and set aside. In a sauce pan, cook onion until translucent with olive oil. If using jarred peppers, add them and garlic together and cook one minute. If using fresh peppers, add those first and cook 5-8 minutes until they brown slightly and get jammy. Then add garlic and cook one more minute.  
  
In a blender or food processor, add mixture from pan and rest of the ingredients. Blend until smooth. I will sometimes add a little almond milk if its too thick. Serve with choice of protein.","1"
