"Fair_Onion_1289",7,7,"Are you able to book the follow up with them at the end of the initial? I agree that it may be helpful to outline what expectations are and what all happens in a follow up session. Like what topics you might cover, how theyre structured, how often you meet to check in, etc. When I first started outpt counseling I found myself assuming by that the client knew a lot of that, but it was so helpful to lay it out more clearly. 

I think its good to save some of the nutrition Ed and goal setting for future follow up sessions, so you can really use that first session for establishing rapport and getting a thorough assessment. I let them know that the assessment is about me getting to know them and their history more and well come up with a game plan together what type of follow up works best for them. 

Also - sometimes it could be where the client is in their stage of change! Ive had a few meet for the first Appmt and never come back. Thankfully, a few shared that it felt like more than they were ready for at the time. I work mostly with the ED population, so we do see cold feet more often.","1"

Thank you this is helpful! I do always start the initial call by telling them today is about me getting to know them and their history etc so I can help them develop the best plan moving forward. Some clients we dont even get to any education/goal setting and others we start briefly. I also do discovery call where I go over what to expect but sometimes Im not sure how well Im explaining. Maybe this is where Im going wrong. I think where I struggle is since its so individualized, I have a hard time verbalizing exactly what to expect.

Would you be okay with a medical doctor photoshopping their residency experience to get by with less training?

To be honest, I would drop them from the internship outright for this behavior, but I understand that can be a difficult undertaking. At the very least, please do be sure that the advisor or the creator of the syllabus or whoever is in that role is aware of the full extent of this intended deception, and I would also consider it important as a preceptor to call this out and talk to the student directly about it regardless of what the program says or does.","1_1_2"

I'm not sure if the exam is the same as it used to be, but when I took it, if you excelled in a specific area you got less questions because it could tell you knew your stuff.

It pulls from a database of thousands of questions so to even have an idea of what's going to be tested on is futile. And the field of dietetics is just so vast, too vast honestly to know in depth every intricate detail of clinical, management and food service is just kind of unrealistic. My NDTR exam ten years ago was also adaptive, similar setup and I know there are less questions on there than for the RD exam, but I don't think it's that aspect that's really causing the major issues. It's the questions themselves and whatever changes they made years back on the algorithms for the test is when we've seen a huge decline in passing scores.

That said - I had to look up the FOCUS model, but my clinical department uses a variation of that ALL the time. Literally anytime we're doing a QI project we're thinking of it in those terms.

If you only have the local bodega/convenience store in your neighborhood (&amp; lack reasonable nutrition education that addresses what is/is not available to you), you are going to do your best &amp; buy whatever you can at said bodega/convenience store with what money you do have. (yep anecdotally, I have stories from both Internship &amp; with my current client population)

"Beane_the_RD",4,4,"This same population, isnt going to be spending whatever extra money they have to purchase supplements &amp; try the newest it food/supplement/food processor (or whatever the influencer is hawking on the socials), they are just trying to survive and are often suspicious of blunt/rude/out of touch practitioners& (gotta love thembut some of the older Docs I work with are clueless on how to talk to patients, they are just accustomed to barking orders &amp; dont understand why a client with no reliable transportation isnt following the instruction?? >&<û@ thankfully, the newer MD/DO grads have SocioEconomic Determinants of Health education wrapped into their Med School curriculum &amp; can better understand/address their needs)
   
Ultimately, it comes down to NOT what we think the patient/client should be doing, its about what changes they want to make &amp; we are to help guide them towards more fruits &amp; veggies, appropriate exercising, stress reduction, religion/spiritual/mind-body practice, etc, etc, etc.
      
To focus only on the food/how the food is made itself, and not take into consideration to broader perspective (i.e.: Socio Economics of a given population, etc), is very myopic from my perspective& hence the reason why my Grad education is Public Health/Social Behavior Systems >7<û@>7<û@>7<û@>7<û@>7<û@ 
       We all have a place at the table, we need to know where the strengths/weaknesses are& it sounds like the CNS route is great for BioChem but does not go into the Community/MNT aspect of Nutrition practice?
   
That being saidas others have mentioned (and from my understanding^), the RD route is older/more established versus the CNS credential having only been around for ~30+ years. While CNS route is allowed in certain State Licensure/Laws, hospitals have to have RDs (per CMS) and this limits the jobs a CNS can have outside Private Practice are less. CNS can practice in the State of Florida, but they are limited in certain areas (Ive only seen 1 in practice in my area& it was private practice cash-pay only and that was years ago)
   
My only anecdote regarding a CNS professional, was with an Eating Disorder client who was told by this CNS to go on the Keto Diet to lose weight &amp; her Body Image will improve& > 
  Yeah& the only thing I have is that this CNS was older (likely got her Masters a few decades prior) &amp; that she was *clearly* not providing MNT to a very vulnerable client. I talked this client off the edge &amp; tried to soothe her wounds about this CNS, but needless to say, that I was very disappointed that this individual didnt recognize the limitations of her knowledge base &amp; refer this client elsewhere. (It also didnt help that this CNS was married to the Chiropractor, in which office she was referred his patients >&<û@>&<û@>&<û@>&<û@>&<û@>&<û@>&<û@>&<û@>&<û@) The client turned to Google &amp; found the private practice I was at, as we have been long established as working with Eating Disorder clients. (I met the owner when I was working Inpatient E.D.s, and she brought me into the fold after that rehab program closed later) 
   
FYIthe RD Internship is a minimum 1200 contact hours (HA! =># you spend wayyyyyyyyyy more time on projects, presentations, paying to work for FREE, etc, than the quoted 1200 hours =>#) plus Case Studies, a sizable Community Nutrition project, production/management/quality improvement in Food Service, plus elective rotations of your choosing (and/or based on the relationships your program has& not everyone has access to an Eating Disorder treatment rotation nor Lobbying through Local/State/Federal Government; it very much depends on the programs focus/connections made) Not to mention the new Masters requirement that must be satisfied prior to sitting for the RD exam.
   
Now that being saidif you have been around here long enough, youve probably seen just how much we gripe about Commission on Dietetic Registration/Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics decisions (and lack thereof) as well as the questionable actions that those high up make (hello! questions of how realistic the RD exam is to actual practice versus nutrition theory, where does the annual CDR/AND fees actually go into helping grow the RD profession?, outside of ANDPAC& does anyone in D.C. know we exist? and other existential crisis-like thoughts that cross our minds &amp; we like vent in here about said thoughts)
    
Its going to take time (and the wheels of change are *slow*) sadly, with the current administrations now-confirmed Head of Dept of Human &amp; Health Services (distanced from his powerful family due to his law firms ambulance-chasing/fear-mongering/lack of understanding of actual scientific research, RFK >"">.>"">.>"">.) its going to be that much more difficult to actually address the root cause of Nutrition/Health Inequity& especially when the heads try &amp; mess with the Farm Bill for the upcoming years (not to mention trying to cut all the programs that actually deal with Food Insecurities, in order to have a small government/save money >,>,=D=D)
   
^ of course I cant find it at the moment (this post Im referring to was ~2-3 years ago?), there is a CNS/RD who spoke of her personal experience on this exact topic on one of the many RD groups on FB& She got her 1st Masters at the University of Bridgeport, and found that outside of cash-pay Private Practice, there wasnt much she could do with her Masters/CNS credential. (CMS rules require the older RD credential &amp; thats assuming that your State hasnt closed out the insurance panels to RDs *cough*State of Florida*cough*) So she went back and got another RD-affiliated Masters, completed the Dietetic Internship, passed the RD exam, and is the Internship Director for the University at which she is a Undergrad Professor.
    
She made it very clear on how much BioChem the CNS Masters is, and how aside from going onto a PhD using the BioChem focus/moving into research, she would not be able to do much more on the Clinical/Community practice side, so she had to go start over again.","3_1_2_1"

* Get to work at 9, because shift starts at 9.

* Boss gets upset you didn't respond to her emails *at 9* because we have regulation changes 3-6x a week since nobody can make a solid plan before announcing anything to government employees.

* Patients are usually entitled POS, playing and manipulating the system, bitching that our system isn't giving *high quality grass fed and organic food* (bitch this thing is for you to live not be a food critic), denying that they aren't parenting properly, and a fuck ton of projection of hate because of their own insecurities or drug addictions. Its a horrific mix of ""my baby/child can do no wrong"" as they raise them on Cocomelon and nuggets + ""im pregant so i am a holy queen. Do it for me."" mentality + they have legitimate issues that are causing the other two. You must recognize it but understand you cannot be their hero.

* if your patients aren't exploiting the system they are below the poverty line and juggling too many things for them to take your shpeal seriously. It cannot be helped and you do understand. You deal with it.

* if they do exploit the system, you're very careful to dance the dance so they don't reveal too much for you to be forced to act upon it. You know if you did, you'd ruin them. But you'd have to or you'd be fired.

* Learned helplessness is rampant. You must be a hardass and make them choose what they want. Not what you want them to want.

So everything is pictures, numbers, and symbols, all explained verbally. They won't remember, they're too busy trying to feed their family and get a roof over their head. But you get it. Your boss who is a slave to reports and demographic data collection doesn't have time to care. Neither do you.

Good luck getting moms attention, the kids are going nuts because they hate the doctor and think you'll call ICE.

They forgot to tell you and miss the appt and don't get food benefits. Whoops? Somehow, that's apparently your fault. 

* Phones ring off the hook, emails are flying, and you need to be linguistically inclined or you're fucked because 70% of clients speak Spanish or Creole or Bengali *and get pissy* when you're not fluent or speak with disdain. My answers is ""I am speaking to you in your language because I can. You are speaking to me in your only language. You will accept my help to the best of my ability or you will get nothing.""

Your basic health insurance is good but if you're not a straight woman who has zero health issues, *get fucked* because the plans don't accommodate well for anything beyond 2 attempts at IVF and a cancer screening.

In any case, most of your list is well studied and a dumb ass like RFK will provide. If you still are in line with RFK and you are truly a dietitian, please go back to school before you treat anymore people. 

1. Ultra processed food are not a single monolith for health. Plus many ""ultra processed foods"" can be quite healthful (and help the environment and animals). 

2. EMR is everywhere. The sun, earth, you me, cell phones, tv signals, etc. So far for the EMRs we use in technology are safe when used appropriately. You want to know the biggest contributor of EMRs to health? The sun as it causes cancer. (unlike glyphosate)

3. Childhood vaccines schedules are fine. You know that. And vaccines are extremely safe. Safer by millions than RFK, Musk, and Trump. 

4. Glyphosate is a non-issue for health when used appropriately. It depends on other pesticides... organic or otherwise. 

5. Artificial food additives... some are safe, some are not, some \*may\* cause behavioral issues. Look up the literature if you have questions. 

6. SSRIs and antidepressants. What is the issue here? They help people with anxiety, depression, and many other mental health issues. Again, the are well studied. 

7. Sure, lets learn more about microplastics. This is the one area that does need more research. But having RFK, Trump, and Musk cutting funding for research is not going to help. But I'm guessing less of an issue than the biggest contributors to health I list below. 

If you really want to know a the biggest contributors to health, chronic disease, and death I dare you look at where billionaires don't want to look... our health care system (e.g. lack of universal healthcare), socioeconomic status (guaranteed minimum income, increased minimum wage, adequate time off and sick leave), housing (housing for everyone), lack of access to food in general and healthy food, education, racism, climate change, pollution, ***capitalism*** (which sort of encompasses everything on this list), etc. Go ahead, I dare you to refocus to the biggest impacts to our health rather than the junk science and debunked ideas RFK is trying to peddle so you'll be distracted from what the Orange Fascist is doing.","27_1"

RDs are very expensive but are mandated by cms. Most w2 RDs inpatient and outpatient dont make their organizations that much money due to benefits and such. 1099 RDs have a higher earning potential, but thats a possibility too. IIt's none of our faults. It's the KAREN RDs when CMS came about who didn't advocate for themselves. Thus, we don't have more reimbursement.


I pulled up the math. An outpatient RD has to see stleast 20 patients a week on average just to cover thier wage of 30 dollars an hour. Most outpatient RDs I know don't meet that patient load.","2_1_1_1"
"peachnkeen519",4,4,"I did the billing for my own private practice about 5 years ago and these MNT CPT codes brought in between $82-140/hr of direct patient contact. So I'm wondering how you calculated 20 patients a week to cover 30/hr wages. Are you calculating overhead such as office space? If so, how did you do that? Genuinely asking.

As far as inpatient goes, there was a published article from the university of Kentucky in the last 10 years (can't remember the exact year right now) looking at RDs role in acute care and malnutrition identification. They actually found $800k increase over the course of 1-1.5ish years with RDs IDing and bringing to physician for agreement and coding. They found the ""value"" of an inpatient RD for malnutrition, of which admin will always want to see financial benefit.","2_1_1_1_1"
"NoDrama3756",1,1,"The company, i.worked for assumed that we would always be reimbursed for the least amount of money in the outpatient setting. The known minimum reimbursement was set 60$ per patient contact hour.


60x20 = 1200. 30*40=1200. the rest is gain but is mostly set aside for profit.  But many outpatient rds don't see 20 a week and will be providing a service at a loss. 

Even nonprofits operate their inpatients and outpatients at a loss due to the cms requirements or a practical need for one.


Honestly I quit my regional director job to be home with my kids more. I moved to outpatient peds. I maybe saw 8-10 kids a week at 30$ an hour. I was not profitable at all for my nonprofit.  Ironic.  Many days I felt really bad because I didn't need to work but the community needed me to work if you get what I'm saying. I was costing more than I brought in. I was not a sound expense.","2_1_1_1_1_1"
"peachnkeen519",2,2,"I know people will look at this at a basic level. Does the RD bring enough reimbursement to meet or exceed the cost of the employee? But this question is really shory sighted for a health system. Which, let's face it, most hospitals and clinics are turning into corporate health systems. 

These places are ACOs (accountable care organization) that have to meet certain metrics for their patients meeting health goals. Obviously CMS looks at accessibility but also quality. An example metric being A1c for patients with diabetes. The ACO does not receive as much reimbursement for the organization as a whole if the A1c's are higher than the goal. This actually behooves the organization to bring in services like diabetes educators and dietitians. Because the overall bottom line and where they are getting a bulk of their money is thru this, not the services we bill for.

I'm not trying to school you, I am really writing this for people to understand the value of the RD is not so simple, and we should not sell ourselves short for $30/hr when that's really not adequate compensation. Having your services available for vulnerable patients is the access that health systems actually need for the overall picture of quality care. While your patient contact hours and reimbursement did not ""profit"" the organization, it did have its value although not as black and white as you are suggesting here.","2_1_1_1_1_1_1"
"NoDrama3756",3,3,"I agree it shouldn't be looked at as a business, but hospital systems, even non-profit hospitals, bring in FOR PROFIT COMPANIES FOR RDs.

There is a huge conflict in such ideologically.  


In that  being a CMS ACO doesn't mandate that the cost saving or improved outcomes as a requirement but as an incentive.  Cms will still reimburse ACOs. Such improved outcomes needs to be q requirement.

There is no reduce a1c to x % for x% of population.
 It's try to reduce a1c and have patients not come in as much.

 There is alot of of ambiguous changes in these cms quality changes.  Ideally.  These quality cms changes should be more objective.  I'm not a fan of the quality model cms will now be using. Screw patient satisfaction.  CMS should be directly looking at facilities that have reduced readmits and improved metrics by objective measures. Example a1c. To be reimbursed for the whole diabetes care, it should reduce whatever % of those with DM below 7% not try too. Do it, or you aren't getting reimbursed at all then eventually you'll lose the ability to bill in the mssp. More objective measures as such will greatly improve preventative and primary care that is very neglected in our country. As RDs we need to be placed more in primary and secondary roles by the healthcare system but are only paid to do tertiary care. Its tragic.

Upper management is responsible for setting goals, formulating policies, and ensuring the company's long-term success.


In that RD wage/salary is calculated for the long term benefit of the organization/ company NOT the individual RDs. The upper management  execs are 1000% more concerned with making as much money as possible for as little as possible. 


Now, when i was a regional director for one of the companies listed above , the wage/salary for RD is set by ppl in upper management with help of ppl with MBAs (usually not RDs).There is a range we can pay based on professional credentials,  experience, and need for a certain position. I, as a regional director, had a little room with pay raises, but it's not like anyone is getting paid 50-60 dollars an hour to just be a clinical RD. Foodservice directors easily can make that much, if not more, in most places.  But not clinical unless vhcol like NYC or San fran.


Example if the positions are separated in the hospital system for accounting/ billing a clinical inpatient RD is paid less than a nicu RD due to thier being more risk in the job and less ppl willing to fill such job. So we pay the nicu position more because no one wants to do such.  We use more money as the incentive to fill the role.

ANDPAC focuses on nutrition access issues like SNAP, WIC, and school meals and on issues that affect RDs as professionals like MNT and IBT coverage in Medicare. They are also a 501c4, so no deductions.

I could go on... and RDs listening to Nutrition Quacks like Dr. Mark Hyman &amp; not critically evaluating his claims.

"Silent-Detail4419",1,1,"***FINALLY***! A dietician who actually understands human physiology! Of ***COURSE*** someone who's obese and diabetic shouldn't be eating fruit - it's pure sugar with ***ZERO*** bioavailable nutrients! There's about 24g of sugar in a 100g banana. Sugar is sugar - it doesn't suddenly become healthy when it comes in the form of fruit. Fructose has a higher glycemic index than sucrose (monosaccharide vs disaccharide). They shouldn't be eating grains either - grains contain ***ZERO*** bioavailable nutrients, are chock-full of [anti-nutrients](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinutrient) \- they are also obesogenic (obesity-promoting). 

I don't understand dieticians telling people with diabetes (either Type I or Type II) to eat carbs. I don't understand a bariatric doctor telling someone who's obese to eat carbs - carbs are what made you fat in the first place - trying to cure obesity by eating more of what made you obese, is like trying to cure lung cancer by increasing the amount you smoke. 

I used to be morbidly obese and I used to be Type II diabetic. I lost over 100kg and reversed my insulin resistance by simply eating the diet I - as a member of the species *Homo sapiens* (an obligate carnivore) - evolved to eat. I stopped eating plants (why would I want to eat something from which I can only not derive nutrition, but which leeches nutrients from anything it's eaten with...?).

My diet consists of plenty of saturated animal fats (fat has no effect on blood sugar, so it's ***IMPOSSIBLE*** for dietary fat to cause obesity. Body fat is excess carbs which have been converted to glycogen and then to body fat by insulin. Hunger is caused by a drop in blood sugar and as only carbs affect blood sugar levels, if you cut out carbs, whilst increasing fat, you stay satiated for longer. It's perfectly possible to manage Type I diabetes via diet alone - if you don't eat carbs, then you don't need insulin. I have a couple of diabetic friends who are managing their diabetes this way. Blood glucose regulation is the job of glucagon, not insulin; it converts body fat back into glucose; so if you're constantly shoving carbs down your throat, then you're not going to be burning your own body fat), red meat, high fat dairy, eggs, poultry, game, bone marrow - I basically try to mimic as traditional a diet as possible. If saturated fat caused heart disease and red meat caused cancer, then the Arctic First Nations who eat a diet high in both saturated fat and red meat - and have done for many millennia - would have become extinct long ago. Cholesterol is ***VITAL*** for life, every single bodily process relies on cholesterol, either directly or indirectly. Braincells need it to stay healthy (I think the demonisation of cholesterol, the promotion of a diet high in grains and the overprescribing of statins is responsible for the rise in dementia - and particularly the rise in early-onset dementia), it forms the myelin sheaths around neurones, it's needed for healthy sperm, and it's vital for heart health. 

We can't digest plants and we cannot derive nutrients from plants - so why would I eat them...?! *Homo sapiens* is an obligate carnivore, we have no physiological adaptations which allow us to derive nutrients from plants; many plants contain anti-nutrients as a defence against herbivory, but herbivores have evolved mechanisms to deal with them - as we're obligate carnivores we have not. We only domesticated plants at the end of the last ice age (10,000 years ago) the giant panda became largely herbivorous around 2.2 million years ago, and it still has the gut physiology of a carnivore. There's ***NO WAY*** we could have evolved to be able to digest them in only 10,000. Then there are all the diseases and disorders caused by grains: obesity, IBS, IBD, coeliac disease, etc. The promotion of grains as healthy is why America is the fattest nation on Earth.","12"

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): HIPAA protects patient privacy by ensuring that personal health information is kept confidential. Treating patients in a public or open area like a waiting lobby would compromise the confidentiality of their health information, violating HIPAA regulations.

Informed Consent: For medical treatment to occur, informed consent must be obtained, usually in a private and controlled environment. Providing care in a waiting lobby may make it difficult to properly inform patients of the treatment's risks and benefits, thus violating this principle


Insurance &amp; Liability Issues: Insurance policies often require that medical treatment take place in designated, safe environments. If

 healthcare workers treat patients outside these areas, such as in a waiting lobby, it could result in a breach of insurance contracts, potentially making the healthcare provider liable for any negative outcome.

The inquiry and emphasis for SOF really came about because I have always aspired to be in SOF. Coming out of high school, had I not had the opportunity to play college athletics, I was planning going and signing an Option 40. Because I had the opportunity to play, I ended up not doing the Option 40 route and pursuing a college education and sports. Now that I will soon have degrees and accreditation in my passions, I was just trying to find a route to mend that with a long-time aspiration of mine!

Give us example when you were a team player? 

What does integrity mean to you? 

If the hospital/company you are interviewing with have  specific core values sometimes the questions are centered around those. I will look those up and think of experiences that exemplify those core values. 

The clinical questions I have gotten have been pretty straight forward e.g. if you have a patient who gets a PEG placed what kind of regimen would you recommend for discharge? 

If a patient with a blindly placed ngt has signs of enteral intolerance, what would you recommend?

The behavioral questions aim to help the interviewer determine your critical thinking and problem solving skills.

I would say pretty much every interview has asked about conflict resolution, weaknesses/areas of improvement, and how you handle difficult cases/areas you don't know as well. 

Good luck!!","6"

Its corporatist propaganda that intentionally obfuscates the reality of current food practices.

I was giving examples of how the employment of thought-limiting cliches (which echo industry talking points) are used for a variety of purposes to shut-down fruitful conversation in dietetics. 

It need not be that these foods share commonality otherwise. Their commonality is the professional employment of thought limiting cliches in dietetics.

I saw in a post from a nutrition sciences PhD about how lowered carbohydrate intake (not keto low, but lower than the 45-60g/meal and 60-75g/meal that many of us are taught to use for diabetes educations) may be beneficial for managing blood glucose levels, and when an RD commented to combat this, he responded saying he doubts the academy would ever change the recommendations due to conflicts of interest or something. I had also shadowed an RD who is a certified diabetes educator at one point, and she was also saying she sees better results with lowered CHO intake (and shes one who loves diving into the CGM data). To me, this is not okay. If there is actual evidence to support updates in recommendations, we need access to that and conflicts of interest should not keep updates from happening.

"discokitchen87",6,6,"As a dietitian previously diagnosed with prediabetes and using a CGM, a much lower carbohydrate intake (and eating protein before carbohydrates INCLUDING high fiber carbs like lentils and beans) absolutely has improved my blood sugar down to normal levels (5.4% A1c). When I told my endocrinologist I was shocked to have blood sugar spikes of over 200 in response to salad bowls with just 30 grams of carbs from high fiber carbs like lentils, he looked at me like I was dumb. 

I ate a blue zones type diet (&gt; 50 grams of fiber daily, mostly whole food, plant-based with some fish and unsweetened Greek yogurt), exercise 6 days/week and have a BMI of 19.5. I was floored when my HbA1c was 5.7% and even more stunned to see my CGM responses to my healthy diet. I brought my blood sugar down with eating animal protein at the start of each meal and then having (fewer) carbs. That way I can even have some beans with my meals and fruit for dessert with no issue.

Somewhat of a rant, and I know everyone responds differently to carbs, but I was really upset that my dietetics education did not help me manage my blood sugar, while the tips from the much-maligned Glucose Goddess and people like Mark Hyman did make a significant difference.

I digress, but the frugal living thing does definitely help. (Google FIRE formula.)

For years, I lied to myself and believed that my low pay was worth doing meaningful work that I love. (That might be true if the systems I work within werent bureaucratic progress- blockers that have been slowly killing my soul.)

If you get to save 50k in the bank, start considering putting that money on a property to park it with the intention to have returns from a tentant. Get property manager involved and learn about it, or if you want to put in work, then you learn how to be a property manager. If you live in an area where you can do air bnb, then consider venturing into that to get you use to owning a property to rent out. Or even just a room of yours. 

Dont go out and party. Just gym, eat at home, church, and everything that you are suppose to be doing anyway. Heck, I still have my iPhone 8plus and I got that for free. Everyone wasting money and bleeding dry.

Please explain where the money to buy a car in cash comes from when all surplus income from a 9-5 RD W2 role is going to paying down student loan debt. As it should, because that debt is accruing interest. 
My post was about CDR raising annual fees with no explanation of how its benefiting us, all while dietitian salaries remain suboptimal, relative to the amount of paid training that is required. There is a massive opportunity cost for choosing to become a dietitian. The risk should match the reward. 

For me, I already own a multi-family home that I rent out. It was a broken down home that needed a lot of work. It was all I could afford with a first time homebuyer low down payment mortgage. I moved away from a HCOL area to a working class city. I spent a year of my free time repairing the home and making it livable. The revenue that it generates goes right back into the home, but it has been a safety net when my family needed it most. I worked hard to get to that point, delivering pizzas, construction side-gigs, waiting tables, and mowing lawns. I dont drink and dont go out. I had the same cell phone for 6 years. My family doesnt go on vacation and we do activities that dont cost money. Im frugal af. I made a lampshade out of paper last week because there was no extra money to buy one. I learn to do repairs on my car on my own to save money. My post was to give a voice to a collective of dietitians that Ive spoken with that have worse situations than mine. They might have had more student loans than me, or not mechanically inclined to save money on repairs, or they have a larger family to support than myself. 
It shouldnt be that difficult to obtain the basics, with a 9-5 W2 that cost nothing short of a spare kidney to obtain. The CDR has done nothing to help the situation for RDs, while asking for more money.

"AllFoodsFit70",9,9,"Just my two cents:
Salaries of RDs won't go up unless the demand is greater than the supply.  Employers have a bottom line and want the cheapest labor they can get but also know it's cheaper to keep an employee than to replace them because they found another job that pays more. However, if you happen to live somewhere with a lot of RDs looking for a job there's not much incentive for the employer to pay more than the going rate. Let's face it, our typical hours and schedule is usually during the day and about 8 hours a day (I know, some days are longer) while a nurse, physician assistant or other health care provider who makes more money is often expected to work evenings, nights or weekends. That to me is a plus of our profession - you can have a home life. Finally there's the issue of reimbursement from insurance companies for the work we do. A PT, SLP or OT gets reimbursement for their employers when they see clients/patients so it's to the employers benefit to employ them. We RDs need to advocate for insurance reimbursement for our services as well as go to the C suite with numbers backing up what we know is true- our work decreases patient stays and comorbidities which saves hospitals money.","7"

If you do decide to go down this route, seek out a therapist to support you in this transition and try your best to separate what you learn in school from what you eat at home.

You also need to figure out if you are entering the profession due to food addiction. Many dietitians enter the profession as an acceptable way to continue their eating disorder without recovering themselves. The decisions you make when you are active in an eating disorder will be influenced by the eating disorder, making you more interested in food and nutrition. My advice would be to fully recover first, and then make a decision that is conscious and not influenced by your eating disorder.","7"

"fruit_fanatic",2,2,"Ill be applying to their program soon and have a few questions! 

For some background, my undergraduate degree (graduating in a few months) is a general nutrition program. It isnt an accredited DPD program but its structured to meet most of the curriculum required in a typical dietetics program. Ive taken anatomy, general chemistry, organic chemistry, nutrition assessment, MNT, food chemistry, and so forth.. I submitted my syllabi from my current program to see if I could surpass their enhancement pathway, but UNE only allowed me to surpass APN 515. I guess my grades also affected their decision despite the relevancy of my coursework. Nonetheless, Im excited to start their program. 

I know of one person currently in this program, so I kind of have a general idea of how it works in terms of finding preceptors and SEL sites.  Im interested in hearing about your experience with the coursework  Did you find the assignments/exams challenging? Were you given adequate time to complete your work? 

and the overall program  What do you wish you knew before enrolling? Was it easy to contact your instructors/mentors? What approach did you take in terms of paying for your tuition?","1_1"
"KickFancy",1,1,"Sounds like you'll have a bit of an advantage having taking some of those basic courses! Most people are career changers with no nutrition background (like myself). There are no exams in the classes (a few quizzes in a few classes). Only outside exam is ServSafe Manager (which I did before I started the program). 


The coursework is challenging but gets easier the more you get used to what the expectations are, however you will be guessing a lot on how to do several assignments and might have to ask a lot of questions. You get one week to do most assignments. There are exceptions for bigger projects that are broken down into parts each week, and capstone where we were able to somewhat make our own deadlines. Each class is 8 weeks and everything including the hours has to get done within that time frame. 


When I had questions I reached out to my instructors or other faculty/writing tutors etc to go over my work. I used financial aid to pay for tuition. ","1_1_1"

Also, do you think these courses adequately prepared you for the RD exam? And were you able to communicate/build relationships with other students taking the courses? 

In terms of financial aid, was it FAFSA? I havent used financial aid through any other routes except the VA which is running out soon. Im trying to figure out what my best options are.

I believe the evidence suggests that  open enteral feeds introduce more bacterial translocation, comparec to closed . 

Obviously, these findings should be applied homogenously.

From a logical standpoint, introducing a whole new level of potential bacterial contamination by blenderizing seems to be unnecessary in certain tube patients  those that are more volatile medically.

Many of the previous studies that showed bacterial contamination of blended feeds there was uncertainty about temperature control and food safety, but also there were not instances of patient illness/harm related to the blended tube feeds either. This is discussed in most of the reviews of blended tube feeds that have been published in the past decade.

The kitchen staff also prepare the meals and blend them but the food service workers here are responsible for ensuring that they are prepared properly and that patients get the correct meal assigned to them.

No apologies, when I say menus I mean literal menus as in chicken and peas no dietary values provided - this is what they want me to develop so they can assess what exactly they are giving patients in terms of nutritional provision. 

And also I believe that the dietitians provide the estimated kcal and protein based on calculations but the doctors here choose the foods/meals to be given, the rate and volume (though I am assuming all bolus unless they are decanting the blended/liquidated foods and using pumps which is unlikely - again yet to find out!)","1_2_1_1"
"Bwrw_glaw",3,3,"The hospital I work at has several standard blended feeds they make in the kitchen. We do have nutrient analysis software, so RDs have access to the micronutrient data for each recipe and can assess if their patient needs any vitamin supplementation in addition. Because of this, generally an admitted patient will be on a single blended recipe for their admission, though if a longer admission or if family desires, the RD may opt to vary the recipe throughout the stay. For patients at home on long-term blended tube feeds, the RD should always be doing a micronutrient analysis of the recipe if only using a single recipe and/or encouraging variation in the fruits/vegetables, grains, proteins, etc that are being used to ensure an overall balanced diet.  
  
Are they currently picking a blended recipe and sticking to that one for an entire admission? Or are they mixing and matching already? Are these recipes that are the same as what's on the oral eating menu and just blended up? Or are they different? Do they know if the meals they're providing to orally fed patients are nutritionally complete? We actually do encourage RDs to think about this more from a plate model - if we were making a breakfast/lunch/dinner for this patient that was balanced, what would we serve? Blend that up and as long as there's some reasonable variety that wouldn't cause you any concern for an oral eater and as long as you're meeting macro needs and accounting for any medical diet needs, you should be good.

Nutrients that are often difficult to meet in blended feeds include sodium (at least in hospitals where they try so hard to make everything low sodium) and vitamin D. It's very easy for vitamin A to be too high (carrots and orange squash are easy to blend...). 

Resources that may be helpful are the Marsha Dunn Klein Homemade Blended Formula Handbook (has recipe building templates for various kcal amounts and tables of what foods are high in what nutrients) and the recently published ASPEN Blenderized Tube Feeding Practice Recommendations. If you can access it, Support Line also had an article a few years back on implementing blended tube feeding into the clinical setting which may be helpful.","2"

But plenty of other facilities are more flexible. Sure start with a 2-3g Na, 1.5-2L fluid diet (~75g consistent carb/meal if they are diabetic ), generally the pt will end up around 1800-2200 kcal. Then we can add snacks/shakes or increase the carbs per meal, or remove restrictions on an individual basis.

 There is also start-up and overhead.  Example starting and llc or s corp can cost a few hundred dollars. My buddies and I started one for about 1k.

It's something I've seriously considered at times, but the uncertainty doesn't suit me well at this time and I value my personal time. Most private practice RD's still need another job for income in the beginning so you'll be working MORE in the beginning for potentially LESS compensation.

I could work more full time, I currently work school hours 8-2:30p and typically only 3-3.5 days/week  and can typically get all my admin done. In 2024 I made 68K.

I don't know what the current reimbursement is for that either but I'm sure you can find out by finding the CMS reimbursement rates.

The CDCES credential IMO is really for credibility and marketing yourself to providers to get a referral stream. Although, I will say that if you want to teach specific to DSME, and the payer does not cover MNT, then this is a way to provide it and you cant do it just as an RD alone. I've noticed straight Medicaid is often this way in the states I've practiced in. Not sure how it is beyond this, I've only lived in 3 states. Depending on your state, the CDCES may allow you to do insulin adjustments I think also... although it's been a hot minute since I closed my practice, I don't know how or if this has changed.

In my private practice, I always billed MNT CPT codes since I would always talk about nutrition in every visit. The billing isn't that difficult since everything is electronic. You just have to have the patience to figure out all the processes for the major payers in your area. If you're only doing diabetes management then you would bill the DSME codes.

It's not that using the product is bad per se, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone unless they needed it. It's a nice to have, but there's no clinical indication for use IMO for the general public. I'm glad you like using a CGM and that it empowers you.","2_1_1_1_1"
"Noobender19",3,3,"Seeing is believing. Its not our role to demonize people who are seeking more information, but to guide them. ","3"
"MidnightSlinks",4,4,"I think seeing a post prandial spike on a CGM can help someone with prediabetes take nutrition or exercise advice more seriously or help someone with high insulin sensitivity stop worrying so much about the macro composition of every single bite they take. 4 weeks (one box) on a CGM can be a powerful tool, especially for patients seeing RDs who can interpret their readings.

Medicare also doesn't cover prescription CGMs unless people are using insulin or have have hypoglycemic events, so I think there's also a place for use in people with type 2 who are not on insulin yet to help them understand their status better than an annual A1c reading does.

I had a family member who was not taking his diabetes seriously aside from taking metformin daily. He actually was insisting that he still only had prediabetes and not diabetes despite an A1c of 9. Slapping a CGM on him for 2 weeks and seeing his BG stay above 170 for more than 24 straight hours after a family gathering had him *running* to his primary care doc asking what the next level of treatment was.","4"
"JustARedditBrowser",3,3,"As a dietitian with Type 1 Diabetes who uses a CGM, I just dont see how this isnt going to be almost entirely a scam for the general population. What they will mostly see is normal blood sugars and maybe the occasional BG thats a bit higher in response to eating a candy with no fat content or drinking a soda. Okay cool& so stop having those I guess. But the conventional advice already covers that. Its a very expensive way to get health data that will be pretty useless. And if people think this might catch people with pre diabetes and diabetes before their doctor well& the doctors should be screening their A1c regularly if they have enough risk factors. Likely a less expensive and less time intensive way to discover this.","5"

"JustARedditBrowser",1,1,"My response to this is that they can also see the results in how they feel, which is free. If people want to use this device, thats fine. If they want to pay for it and see what happens to their BG, go ahead. But I do think, without any guidance on what those results mean, the ability to take action may be misinformed or difficult to do. You mentioned in another comment that you ate pancakes and felt tired and saw that your BG spiked up. My argument is that you already know pancakes lead to feeling tired. Does knowing that a high blood sugar may have been the reason going to be a huge additional motivator? Maybe for some, but not for a lot of people. 

My ultimate position on CGMs for the general population is that they are mostly a gimmick, and, if someone asked me if they should get one without a medical need for it, I would recommend they save their money. That being said, if I were working with someone who really wanted to go for it and could afford to do so, of course I would incorporate the data as part of our discussions about their goals and what they want to do nutritionally. Ive been in this field long enough to know that, if its not harming someone, you just kind of have to go with some of these things to build rapport. But I do worry about the wellness industry taking advantage of people with this by convincing them they can biohack their life with supplements or food products to control blood sugar that are mostly snake oil.","5_1_1"

Or just use brown rice with saucy meals. Get used to it and gradually switch to only brown rice.

Also, you may want to explore why you find talking food in general difficult. I know Ive had to do some work on growing up food insecure and how I approach eating with people who appear food greedy (like my in laws). Ive also had to work on growing up being judged and hearing comments on weight like it was normal. Being self aware of my biases really helped me accept myself and others situations and talk more openly about food and individual feelings about it.","5_1_1"
"[deleted]",6,6,"No, it's not just you. It sounds like imposter syndrome. I definetely felt embarrassed early in my career when I got drawn into conversations about ""good"" versus ""bad"" food, and didn't know how to respond. That binary thinking that many people fall into and expect us dietitians to agree with (""What? You mean I can have/don't have to give up\_\_\_\_""). And yet I made the mistakes early on of getting caught up in that mindset.

At the time, I didn't understand the nuance involved. We -- and the public -- must remember that nutrition science is a soft science; it is not like physics. However, people often try to apply the laws of physics to it. Or the laws of medicine/taking a medication.

Nutrition is complex because its deeply personal and highly variable. No two people eat the exact same way. Individual factors like genetics, metabolism, gut microbiome, lifestyle, culture, and personal preferences all deeply influence dietary needs and responses to food.

Unlike medicine, where a 10 mg dose of a drug is standardized and expected to produce a relatively predictable effect, food doesnt work that way yet we expect it to. This is why nutrition science is so difficult to do.

What helped me overcome this was learning more about the subject and finding ways to navigate conversations with context. Ive learned to focus on patterns in eating to get people out of black and white thinking, like: What else are you eating? How much are you eating of \_\_\_\_\_ (food in question)? And how often?","6"
"Adventurous_Dog_4552",3,3,"Thank you for your detailed response. I agree with you completely.

When we get harsh pushback we all tend to question ourselves& but usually end up being right or able to find our source of information. I think overcoming that just takes time and practice and understanding how to deal with individual patients because everyone is going to receive information differently. 

I also think the more you understand a particular area, the more comfortable you are educating someone on the subject. For me, I was always hesitant to talk about diabetes recommendations, so got my CDCES so I could feel more competent in that area when discussing with patients (not saying you have to do this, just an example)","6_2"

However. I don't think this type of skill is necessary to be a dietitian and it's not for everyone. Your skills may be better for non-patient facing roles and supporting nutrition and health promotion in a different manner. I know our profession needs that sort of diversity in thought and different strengths and I appreciate those differences between nutrition professionals.

"Guavagirl1503",1,1,"Yeah agreed, compensation is limited in healthcare settings in general. I worked acute care (3.5 years); everything from oncology floors, surgical, ICU and as a contract dietitian at SNFs (1.5 years). I decided to transition out to SLP, but also considered PA school which require the same level of education but have more earning potential in healthcare, and have decent work life balance. Depending on your state and COL/ setting, pay will vary. In Austin I left making about 65k per year, and I had to negotiate hard to get there. Ive been told from RDs who have decades of experience and who work in the ICU are capped at about $39/hr working full time. From what Ive been told, working outpatient generally pays the least&.you can make closer to 6 figures in management positions, although Ive heard the work life balance is generally pretty tough. I also agree, nutrition is more appropriate as a preventative measure, which is what had drawn me to it to begin with!

I would suggest researching the areas of nutrition outside of healthcare that are interesting to you, and what the pros and cons look like, no need to rush such an important decision. To me personally, it  just made more sense to transition to another field that had higher pay.","2_1_1"
"vergingon",3,3,"You can do a didactic program but depending on what courses youve taken (and when) you might end up basically doing an entire undergraduate degree. 

If youre in the US, check out University of Arizona online. They offer an accredited program so you can see exactly what kind of classes youll need to take. 

I career changed and had to take every class in the major plus a few science prerequisites (chem, bio, microbio). Plan on about 2-3 years if you need to so the same (at a full time rate). 

 Then yes, you do an additional internship (usually about a yearunpaid). Save up as much as you can. 

The program will tell you that you cant work during the internship. You can if you need to, it just sucks and you will have little to no work life balance. You need a job thats nights/weekends and very understanding. 

A lot of programs are attaching themselves to graduate programs now so you might end up having to at least do a certificate program to get into an internship. if you find a stand alone internship though (they still exist), be prepared to finance the entire $10k+. If youre in the US, the internship doesnt qualify for financial aid without being attached to a graduate program. 

The worth it question is so subjective, only you can answer that. Search this sub lots of people have asked the same thing and it really comes down to what you value, your interests and what your goals are with dietetics. You technically only need an RD license to deliver nutrition as a therapy. Is that what you want to do? 

Think difference between personal trainer and physical therapist. You can do stuff with nutrition and health in general without being an RD.

But being an RD (or even a CNS) can help open some extra doors. 

Personally, I think dietetics is worth it if you want to build your own business/get into food industry/become a diabetes educator, you dont mind if people dont listen to you, and you are ready to talk about why carbs arent actually terrible, and how yes, more veggies will generally help with that hunger/bloating/irregular BMs.

Otherwise, its not a super well paid profession when you get into it, you probably wont get paid a decent amount until at least year 3 (depending on location, what you do and any advanced certs you do), there can be issues with other health professionals not understanding/not respecting dietitians (because what do we know?), and a lot of complaints about pay/respect.

Thats all being said, there are some awesome people who work in dietetics and do amazing things. Usually because theyve created the opportunities themselves. So its really up to you to make the profession work for you if this is what you want to do.","3"

"JDA_Edits",2,2,"The person commented this likely because being an RD is not financially worth it for most people. Most jobs are in Healthcare (Hospitals, then Nursing homes). Pay is not very good in most parts of the U.S for RD roles.

If you get good pay, it'll be in a HCOL area, so it balances out unless you get a roommate/or spouse.

Some high paying RD jobs aren't that RD related or likely the reason why you want to get into the field in the first place. This includes clinical nutrition managers (admin of RD staff at hospital), food service directors (hospitals/nursing homes/schools, explaining why you cant make a pb&amp;j sandwich to nursing staff), and supplement sales.

Private practice is a good route for $$ and passion if you like counseling. BUT, it's a business with its own hardships. Also, if you just want to coach weight loss, you dont NEED an RD. For clincial conditions you do need and RD, and insurance.

If you become an RD, some other jobs are WIC nutritionists (low pay but can eventually be promoted to director, but again, this is not an RD role, mostly Admin over nutrition program). 

Corporate dietitian, hard to find + need to advocate for your skillset but can be a decent salary and work related to RD credential. 

Sports Dietitian for a team, but harder to get in and you got to pay your dues.

Overall, think of the job you want. I'd advise against getting the degree/RD just because you are interested in nutrition. You can self teach online. If you really want this field, ask to shadow RDs in the job you are interested in. Look on linked in and message people for short interviews asking about their job duties/qol. If you are interested in private practice, learn what you can now and start without the RD. Once you get clients and a feel for if you like doing private practice/nutrition coaching, THEN go get your RD and still work a little during your internship (i knew a guy who did this).

Also the dietetic internship is unpaid, you have to pay for it. You will work around 9 months for free, M-F, 9-5pm. 

For the verification statement, you need to go to an accredited DPD college. You can ask the college in your area.

But to answer your questions

1. A plant based died, that focuses on plant protein, is usually the first step in improving kidney health. This is to  reduce uremic toxins (NEAP) which can be done by eating more fruits/ veg/legumes and less meat, diary and refined sugars. This can look like  a Mediterranean/dash diet. However its important to create a meal plan that is not a one size fits all and is more individualized. There are many cultures diets that can fit a kidney friendly diet. 

2. Protein allowances can vary based on etiology and stage. Diabetes generally has a little higher protein allowance. But general guide stage 3) 55-.60 g protein/ kg. Stage 4-5 consider VLPD (.28-.43 g protein/kg) supplemented with keto acid analogs. 1.2 g/kg for dialysis patients 

3. Usually phosphate additives ( found in refined grains and processed foods) is the first mineral limited. This is because it is absorbed more readily then natural phosphorus. Limitations on phosphorus and potassium are usually determined based on labs and urine output. Unless potassium restrictions are necessary you want to avoid, as this nutrient helps with blood pressure control.","1"

"FullTorsoApparition",13,13,"IF is perfectly fine for many people as long as it helps them maintain a calorie deficit and they're able to fit enough nutrition into their eating window. I believe recent studies have demonstrated that it's no better or worse than a traditional calorie deficit, but some of my clients find the simple rules easier to adhere to.

For example, setting an arbitrary 8pm cut-off window for their eating helps them be more mindful about late night snacking. However, my anecdotal experience has shown me that they still plateau eventually because they start breaking their fasts with heavier and heavier meals and often continue to eat calorie dense foods.

Eventually I have to explain that *what* they eat is probably still more important than *when* they eat. IF isn't a magic formula that lets them eat whatever they want as long as they fast afterwards.","2"
"ihelpkidneys",2,2,"Hi! Understandable, thankyou for your opinion
Idk, Ive always just thought that telling yourself you cant eat if you are hungry leads to a heavier than normal meal when you finally do eat. 

Just me, but I know when I let myself get too hungry, when I finally do eat, feel like overeaten. But understand everyone is different","2_1"
"FullTorsoApparition",3,3,"Yeah, that's why it doesn't work for everyone. Many of my patients don't experience hunger until later in the day, so IF is a good fit for them and keeps them mindful about late night grazing.

I personally think it's more beneficial to have planned, regularly scheduled meals or snacks every 2 to 4 hours, but getting some people to adopt that change can be very difficult.

An issue I often run into is that my clients simply don't want to put any effort into their food. For many of my clients, it seems like food is an inconvenience that they try to put off as long as possible until they can't stand it anymore, then they binge on tasty foods that are ""worth their time.""

When they come to us for medications, the impression I get is that they simply want to never feel hungry and want to be able to avoid thinking about food as much as possible. Until healthier foods are a priority and become something they put real time and effort into, they don't typically get much long term success.","2_1_1"

Using IF as a tool as can slow metabolism because you are putting your body in starvation mode if they are not starting their eating window early enough.

Find the lever or combo of levers that work for you (aka that feels the least restrictive to you) and sustain that.  If a patient comes to me with an interest in trying it, I support them in optimizing protein and nutrient intake, and making sure its not excessively restrictive.

For some people, it feels so easy to just have simple boundaries in their eating time which helps them eat in a calorie deficit. If having an earlier dinner and then stop eating, or skipping breakfast feels natural and easy, then its an easy win.  

I dont recommend true intermittent fasting (like every other day eating) as its impractical and could pose risks (physiologically and mentally/related to disordered eating).

It's easy to say but have a little grace,  it's ok to not know something in the moment, so long as you circle back to continuously grow your knowledge.

Listening to your patient or client often guides practice as well. You may not know the exact answer, but you can pair what you know about food with what the person is absolutely willing or not willing/ able to do and come up with a plan.

I think you should look at your imposter syndrome in a different light.  See it as a good thing so that you continue to learn, research and welcome new ideas and opinions.  Over confident people who believe they have all the answers are often the people who know nothing.

When I started my current hospital job (its a small hospital so I have responsibilities in all areas of dietetics) I had to help develop the bariatric surgery program.  Weight loss surgery is not my specialty and Ive never been that interested in it so I had to learn everything over again and more.

We work mostly with the football players, but we do work with most of the other team and Olympic sports too. For someone like this, this is what my boss has taught us and encourages our athletes regarding protein for weight training:

-total intake of around 2g/kg/day

-post workout intake of 0.3g/kg (preferably of whey based protein, but if they want plant based then it should be leucine rich), though tbh we usually just simplify it to about 25-30g regardless of size since that matches the options that we carry for them and we would end up with a ton of wasted product if they were trying to measure out 1.3 protein shakes or something lol

-intake should be a steady amount regularly through out the day (as opposed to like a carb heavy breakfast then consuming 100g at lunch, or eating breakfast at 7am and then not eating again until 7pm)

-30-40g shortly before going to bed for the night

2g/kg is likely sufficient for the recreational athlete in a slight calorie deficit for fat loss (I am assuming thats what hes going for after the bulking phase). 
You can probably find recommendations for higher intakes in the literature, but I have found it is often difficult for my clients/athletes to get in more than 2g/kg protein in their diet. If this person is just training for health &amp; fitness they are going to be much better off aiming for sustainable over the extreme. Same goes for the calorie deficit. Since he is so active, a moderate deficit (200-300kcal/day) is going to help him avoid under fueling for training sessions and prevent rapid muscle loss.

"ShredLabs",-5,-5,"Hey thereyour 26-year-old male client at 205 lbs, training 5x/week, sounds like hes got a solid foundation from his bulk to maintain that weight. Now that hes shifting to a cut for fat loss, nailing protein is key to preserve muscle. Without lean body mass or body fat %, well base it on his total weight, height (assuming average, \~510 if unlisted), and high activity level.

For cutting, research like Schoenfelds (2016) meta-analysis suggests 0.8-1.2g of protein per pound of body weight to maintain muscle in a deficit, especially for active lifters. Given his 205 lbs and 5x weekly strength training, Id lean toward the higher end to play it safe1.0-1.2g/lb. Thats 205-246g of protein daily. It accounts for his training volume and ensures muscle retention while he drops fat. Start at 225g (roughly 1.1g/lb)its practical, aligns with his goals, and adjusts for not knowing exact LBM.

Misinformations rife, but stick to evidence-based ranges from ISSN or JSCR studies0.8-1.2g/lb is the sweet spot for lifters cutting. Pair it with a moderate deficit (300-500 kcal below maintenance) and keep carbs decent for training energy. Hows his current diet trackingany protein baseline to tweak from?","11"

how quick it is to document &amp; that it doesnt need to be super specific- estimate 25/50/75% and move on with your day, no need to investigate the tray to ensure its exactly 40% consumed!

Also giving alternate suggestions to documenting every time the patient completes a meal can help improve documentation.

&gt;* T2DM
&gt;* mild dementia
&gt;* all labs wnl.

&gt;Taking metformin 500 mg once daily, and rosuvastatin minimum dose once daily. These were prescribed even though labs for both were wnl (A1c of 6.8).

&gt;Eats 45 g CHO all day, as per her nurse daughter's recs, but who knows where she got that number from. I asked her other daughter - who cares for her - if she knew where her sister got that number from, but she didn't know. Supposedly, her doctors and her nurse daughter want her A1c to be lower than her current, even though she's 74.
&gt;
&gt;I don't agree with her current carb intake because she's very skinny, and older, and both the other daughter and I agreed that she benefits from a bit of weight gain. Nor do I think a lower a1c is warranted.

&gt;How many grams of macros would you recommend? If I were to keep her at 45 g of CHO, that would mean her protein and fat intake would have to be really high, which may not be realistic.
&gt;
&gt;I'm asking for numbers because her daughter wants a sample meal plan. Thank you.

(Just reformatted to make that easier to read for people.)

I'm also inclined to say that CHO intake is low and I would likely end up raising it, but I'd want to know much more about this patient's actual situation before I made a meal plan for them. I wouldn't touch the idea of providing a meal plan until I know how the patient is actually eating and how she feels about what she's currently eating.

What's the situation? Is she in a SNF or LTCF? Why are you seeing her? What's her weight trajectory been like? Her P/O intake? How did the counseling session go? Did she say anything about the low carb diet, the food/her appetite, etc.?  Obviously weight gain would be great, but we don't know the barrier to that from what you've given us. Does she forget to eat? Does she not like the food she has? Does she have dentures? Has she had a swallow study/does she have dysphagia? Does she not like the food she gets and would prefer to have something else or higher carb? Is she getting too much volume? Is she getting enough fluid? How does she take her fluid, with or without meals? What's her A1c or glucose trend been? How well does she ambulate? What are **her** goals for her care (e.g. does she want to prolong her life at any cost, or does she want to maximize comfort even if it means liberalizing treatments)? Other than the eGFR, what sort of idea do we have of her kidney function?  What are her bathroom habits and might those impact her eating habits?

You'll make substantially more money staying in the trades. Especially as an electrician. If you go the fellowship route you'll make bank and have job security given the projected trades shortages. 

I don't ~regret~ becoming an RD. But the pay is abysmal for what you're expected to learn. Respect in the hospital is hit or miss, usually a miss. And patients generally give you lip service regarding provided education so it can be kinda draining. 

There are some who find joy in this field. Lots do not. Some say it's an Mrs. Degree (female dominated field, with low pay). Others have some success. 

Advice from a random internet stranger, stick with the trades. Going this route will land you debt equivalent to a master's program with worse pay than a nurse. 
You'll save much more money, and be able to retire in a reasonable time frame.

""The reasoning is that linoleic acid, the most common omega-6, is converted into arachidonic acid in the body, which is a building block for compounds that cause inflammation. While this may sound convincing, a 2017 meta-analysis of randomized control trials found that increased dietary intake of linoleic acid does not have a significant effect on blood concentrations of inflammatory markers. This is likely because only a small percentage, about 0.2%, of omega-6s is converted to arachidonic acid.""

""What many anti-seed oil influencers also overlook is that arachidonic acid is also a precursor for compounds that fight inflammation in the body. Many studies, including 2023 research in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, show a higher intake of omega-6 fatty acids is associated with better cardiovascular health and improved glucose metabolism.""

BURN OUT: Be mindful of volunteering to work long hours to please your supervisor. There might be situations when supervisors only want to fill the FTEs because they're under pressure. Just because you take all the hours doesn't mean it will pay off. Especially in hospitals, job titles, and departments are created and eliminated constantly.

PAY: Research salaries in areas you want to work and always negotiate instead of accepting the first offer that comes your way.

Topic list may include: self-monitoring/meal tracking, plate model, portion sizes, label reading, proteins, fats, fiber, added sugar, hydration, gut health, whole grains, fruits &amp; veggies, vitamins &amp; minerals (usually one at a time for the relevant ones), phytonutrients, antioxidants/anti-inflammatory nutrition, meal timing, mindful eating, meal planning/grocery shopping, recipe ideas, supplements, alcohol, hunger/fullness signals, emotional eating, relationship with food, dining out, medications impacts on nutrition; and non-food related topics like stress mgmt, sleep hygiene, exercise, &amp; behavior change principles

I think our issue is that RDs dont have concrete ROI to track from Medicare reimbursement (which usually commercial eventually follows suit for big changes). 

PTs, OTs, SLPs, audiologists, are only cost savings in that aspect, too. Other allied health professions sell largely services rather than a product, and still make far more than dietitians. But if you look at historical progression of insurance coverage of these professions services, its pretty mind blowing. You can clearly see that dietitians were some of the last in allied health to be covered by Medicare. And we are still so far behind. Theres been the MNT Act bill presented in the last 3 congresses now, and has died out all 3 of the 2-year sessions due to inaction. Its even had bipartisan support and is co-sponsored by Republican and Democrat mix.

-our field is disproportionately composed of decently well off white women who have the financial support of family or a spouse to fall back on so have not demanded or sought out higher pay
-people take low paying positions without questioning it. If no RDs took low paying roles, hospitals would have to increase either salary or benefits to attract better applicants
-women tend to not ask for raises or negotiate salary as aggressively as men, though I think this is changing. Still, this keeps the average pay down for the profession as a whole

"Kreos642",2,2,"Hello

While I'm not gunning for FSN, I am going international. I can at least help you with that part. 

1) most countries do not have reciprocity with licensure but might with education. Aka; You'll need to make sure your education let's you sit for an exam, and then have to pass their exams to be licensed in each country before you practice *in addition to* maintaining your credentials. To check which county needs what, you have to find that respective countries equivalent to their CDR. You can find these by looking into the International dietetics association and by emailing folks at the CDR for USA to see if they can get you in connection with a liason. Unfortunately for you, registration in multiple countries does cost money and does mean more exams and allocating time. The reality of it is as such; bit changes take time.



2) you need to not just ""know the language"" but be *fluent* in the language. Self study usually doesn't cut it if you're already a full time employee. It may be best to enroll in a language school or take language courses. See if you can adjunct a class at a local college. You need to have a level of professionalism in your speech in addition to medical terminology so keep that in mind as you learn. 



3) you have to look into visas and visa sponsorship laws for each country and determine if those are feasible for you. Your criminal record will come into play here, including things like DWI and having cannabis or drugs. Applying for these can take any amount of time depending on where; and you still need to get *approved*. Your best bet is to get a visa sponsorship with an employer.



4) You need experience, to be honest. I'd at least continue working towards your dream job here while you pursue the routes you need to take.



5) your passport has to be up to date and documents neeed to be accurate. If you're in the US, you need to have your license, Real-ID, and passport all have the exact same name and DOB, etc, to match your social. Don't fuck around with this or coming home will be an issue. Make sure the photos are semi-recent, too. Your name does *not* need the same surname on your US issued CDR card (i checked recently because I am newly married). But see if that's an issue abroad.



6) make sure you're on top of laws about insurance and internationals. For example if you're in Portugal, can you take international insurance or international patients legally? Or is it direct reimbursement only? Just be aware of that.","2"
"kiravance",2,2,"Hi, so I can't speak to any part of the foreign jobs question, as I'm from the US and have no experience there. However, I do have a degree in nutrition and culinary arts and do a lot of the tasks that you listed under your ideal job. I think you are limiting yourself here - the jobs you will be looking for aren't dietetics per se, but more like quality control/regulatory/food safety with a sprinkling of nutrition related. It is really going to depend in what part of the industry you want to work - a lot of the nutrition related work could be done in hospital or healthcare settings. You may have to do some 1:1 evaluation, but it wouldn't be like a therapy setting, typically.

Every other piece, there, including auditing, technical documents, quality control, hygiene inspections lead this to be more of a food safety specialist or quality control/regulatory specialist job, which is what I ended up doing with my degree. If that is the route you'd prefer to go, I'd definitely look into HACCP courses, ISO would be good (ISO 9001 for auditing, FSSC 22000 for Food Safety) especially since you are in Europe. If you end up going into production plants/manufacturing, GMPs would be good to learn also. Hope that helps - good luck!

  
Edit: FSSC 22000 not ISO 22000, although both good.","3"

You could get some certifications - I have a CP-FS (Certified Professional-Food Safety) from NEHA (National Environmental Health Association) but those are based on US/FDA food standards.

That said, I think it can be frustrating if other healthcare providers are showing a constant lack of understanding for what clinical dietitians actually do and the value they bring as clinicians, so that drives a desire to push away from food service and any association with it. Similarly if you're trying to do your clinical job and patients only want to complain to you about something you have no control over - that will get wearisome with time.","1"

Im learning negotiating skills and thats exactly what he was doing. And he clearly had the upper hand. 

I strongly encourage every Dietitian to at least study 10 hours of negotiating skills! I wish it was taught colleges.

A third reason is, Ive met many dietitians that say that theyre not too concerned about their income because theyre married to a man that supports whatever lifestyle they need and that their income is just a secondary and doesnt really matter.  

In that case, Ive told him that they should just stay home and not denegrate the importance of our work by accepting a poor salary.","3_1_2"

They complain that theyre asked to bring pudding to someones room when theyre so busy figuring out clinical issues. Dude, youre doing a 45 min assessment to recommend ensure TID. Bringing someone that pudding might actually be a more effective intervention that Ensure TID. 

I say that from experience and being around as an RD for the last 12 years, mostly in skilled nursing. I also have had many kitchen staff tell me all about the RDs they have experienced and a lot of those experiences were the RD was basically emphasizing how much education they have and how they are the expert on everything. 

If youre starting out, my best advice is to learn from your kitchen staff. You can learn so much from the cooks. Its a two way street. They learn from you and you learn from them but you have to allow them to teach you things which requires admitting you dont know everything after all.","4"

The kitchen is the backbone of all of the work we do as dietitians, both on a clinical and foodservice side. Without all of the hard work foodservice staff do to prepare the diets, snacks, and nourishments there would be no point in having a clinical dietitian at all.

"Prior-Golf-1247",3,3,"As someone who works as both a Food Service Manager and Clinical RD at the same hospital, I have personally experienced both ends of the spectrum on this. On one hand, I bring a unique perspective to the clinical team and am able to answer a lot more of logistical questions that patients may have regarding food service. From my experience, the large majority of patients dont even understand what an RD is or what we do. And that sucks but thats the reality for a lot of patients. Working in FSM allows me to round with patients and field a lot of food service questions that wouldve otherwise been asked to the clinical RDs. A large majority of clinical RDs also dont know the reality of the day to day responsibilities of a FSM RD. Although all of my current colleagues are not RDs, there is a huge benefit for being an RD in educating both my employees and also patients. But working in FSM is way more than the normal RD duties/NCP like payroll, performance management, health inspections, orientating new employees, budget management, supply chain management, menu planning, etc and a lot of which you dont know how to do until you begin working in FSM.

The thing is, you can and SHOULD be intricately part of the menu planning, kitchen staff education, resident complaints and issues with food quality control. Why? Because it directly impacts how well our patients do with meal completions and getting adequate nutrition. Many kitchen staff are not well educated on nutrition. Talk to the Food Service Director about doing short in-services every month or perhaps 1 minute of nutrition ed every time they do huddles. You are the nutrition expert - let them see you, know you and gain knowledge from you. Institutional kitchens can be intimidating at first - they are loud, large and often chaotic. Get to the know the staff on an individual basis and let issues come up in conversation organically. They often have good ideas.  YES it takes time. Not everyone is friendly at first. Compliment people when you see them do a good job, offer to help when they look overwhelmed. Yes, I have a masters' degree and I've run trucks up to the floors sometimes. Never imply someone's tasks are beneath you. Talk to the Food Sve Dir about having an improvement committee that perhaps meets quarterly where you include some of your cooks and line staff. Make it a team project. Yes, it can get old hearing staff and resident/patient complaints about the food. You are a 'front of the house' person as we used to say in the restaurant world. When I waited tables and the cook screwed it up, it wasn't my fault but it directly impacted my customer's dining experience (and ultimately my tip). Managing someone's expectations, allowing them to feel heard and being responsive (""Here's what I""m going to try to do"") goes such a long way.  We need to combat the notion that food service is ""below us"" or ""not our problem"". It's SO important. Take pride in being part of food service.

How I got PP started or my university role?

PP - I started doing nutrition talks and macro coaching while I was in grad school with members of my current and previous CrossFit gym and then work of mouth has allowed me to sustain my 3 clients at a time, most of the time. Sometimes I have less.

"snaptree321",1,1,"There's so much to consider! I did read through some of your previous posts for context, and here are some thoughts:

1. I'm a career changer, too! I knew when I went back to school for my RD that I wanted to open my own business, which is the main reason I chose this path. We're allowed to be independent providers with our own private practices, and that was appealing to me. There are also a lot of opportunities for RDs to own businesses or find jobs OUTSIDE of healthcare, since food/nutrition is a big topic. That option appealed to me, also. I did kind of second-guess my decision to become an RD in the first couple of years, but I now own a group private practice and I really, really enjoy all of the different responsibilities and challenges that come with it. I think it's a really great use of the various skills I've honed over different careers, not just nutrition stuff.

2. You say that you have no interest in working for yourself. It's so great that you know that. And also great to know that high pay isn't everything to you. In clinical or community nutrition, expect roughly the same pay as what you made as a teacher. Sure, we can push for higher salaries in these places, but I do think people coming into the field should understand the reality of what the pay ranges are right now and not necessarily expect them to increase. There are other jobs that you could get higher pay for, like long-term care facilities or medical sales, but it sounds like that's not what you're interested in.

3. You mentioned a VA internship in one of your posts. If you want to work in a clinical setting, VA jobs are the highest paying RD jobs in most areas. I know there's a lot up in the air with the VA right now, but if these RD jobs continue to exist, they seem great for RDs who like clinical. 

4. Like others have said, RN CDCES typically pays better than RD CDCES. It's also worth considering that if you enjoy clinical work, you hit a salary AND career ceiling almost immediately as an RD. Sure, you might get promoted to management/administration, but those roles are limited and they would mean not doing the patient education/nutrition/preventative healthcare that you love. If you become an RN, you have the option to become an NP later on if you feel stuck, which comes with a significant pay bump AND a big expansion of your role and responsibilities. It seems like you'd just have more options down the line as an RN if a) making more money became important to you or b) you felt stagnant in your position and wanted to advance in the field. 

5. You say you're passionate about nutrition, and that's AWESOME. You'll probably love learning more and more about it as time goes on. Keep in mind, though, that most patients you work with or give educations to won't be very passionate about it, that other healthcare specialties may not respect your passion and expertise, and that there often isn't much room for nuanced nutrition education or counseling in clinical settings. I know lots of clinical RDs who are frustrated because patients don't want to hear what they have to say and other providers don't utilize their expertise. 

All of the above is loaded with my own bias, of course, so take it with many grains of salt. There's no ""wrong"" choice, and there are so many different paths you could take within either field.","11"

I will say, its very important to love where you work (like with any job). Ive only ever worked in Childrens hospitals and cancer centers and Ive never had a bad experience. I think its very dependent on how respected the RD is in that institution and how much they let you do independently.

"popsicle22wolves",3,3,"I couldnt agree more with the statements above, people come here to rant (me included) but I love my job as an RD! Dont get me wrong, it has some downfalls but every job has a few! In outpatient, take what others say with a grain of salt because people will ultimately believe what they want. We can try and guide them to a better result but at the end of the day its on that individual and if theyre not ready to change we wont be much help. Id say the most difficult part of outpatient is trying to not take your job home with you and not letting silly people on social media get to you (my current struggle lol). Personally, Ive not had any struggles with respect from other providers aside from one and theyre no longer with the clinic if that says anything about their behavior :) 

As for advice, I recommend shadowing a few dietitians to see what your niche is! Its something I wish I did prior to my internship so I had a better idea on what I was getting into. I personally had no clue what I liked out of the internship and tried it all foodservice, LTC, acute care, and now outpatient community health! Outpatient can be broad like in community health where you see a multitude of conditions, or specialty like eating disorders. If you have interest in outpatient I HIGHLY recommend shadowing a specialized RDN in eating disorders; it was a game changer for me and my patients. Unfortunately, Ive been seeing a strong increase in disordered eating and anticipate outpatient will likely be seeing more with 90s diet culture start to show back up on socials. 

As for money, I wont sugar coat it. The money isnt great for the amount of school we put in, BUT I am seeing salary increases slowly. As for loans, Im currently 83k in the hole and will happily pay minimum payments until it finally goes away (holding out for a hero here lol). If youre wanting doctor, physical therapist, PA kind of money; this might not be the best thing for you. That being said, Im comfortable with my wages. I live in a MCOL-HCOL city and am able to have my own apartment, fairly new car, and still indulge in my hobbies. What it really boils down to is the lifestyle youre comfortable with. If youre cool getting store brand food sometimes to save a few and living in a decent but not luxury apartment; youll be riding smoothly. 

I agree with the poster above as well, private practice is the way to make that CASH, but it comes with its own costs (insurance, LLC, possible multiple state licensing, accounting, etc.). We arent taught too much about this in school, but once you get past the administrative hurdle its fairly smooth sailing. Social media is a GREAT way to start getting a following for potential future clients, just be ready for the good ole internet trolls lol. This could also be a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills to future internships if you do continue down this road.

Unfortunately, it is expensive to become an RD between the masters requirement and the unpaid internship. I think its up to you to decide if the type of job you would like is worth taking on the extra time and money to pursue an RD.

I checked with ACEND to be sure the masters I already earned will at least allow me to meet the masters degree requirement to become an RD so no need to get another one of those. I hope Im explaining it well enough. Theres an added layer of nonsense since I have an MS in nutrition already.

I worked with EDR in a resident facility that specifically focused on your age group. There's a steadfast rule we had to follow: no talking about nutrition to the patients outside of therapy and dietetics sessions. Reasoning was that the patients would (and have an excessive number of times that led to this rule) use the knowledge to justify their behaviors of their ED and inhibit the rehab of themselves and their peers. 

You've had your ED for *years* - you need to get some real, solid, l professional help and get into ED remission.

Does this childs excess weight come with biochemical markers like elevated A1c, liver enzymes, cholesterol? Is their weight making it difficult for them to exercise? Is their diet filled with low nutrient, high sugar items? Is their weight trend suddenly changing and are they rapidly gaining weight?

If yes, then Id recommend an intervention to slow the weight gain and let the child grow into a healthier balance of weight to height. 

But If the kiddo is eating decently balanced, getting in daily physical activity, and their labs are fine and their growth curve is on its own path I probably wouldnt be worried, just encourage parents to keep offering opportunities to eat well and explore new ways to be active. 

Basically Im balancing the likelihood of teen dieting being a risk to mental health and the physical risks of rapid weight gain and obesity thats clearly damaging the body.

The Joey and the backpack are QOL game changers for some people- the battery life, the distance needed between the pump and the bags, the small size and weight etc. I have heard the same thing that the bags are being phased out and it's super frustrating, I've already had to send new pump patients home with Omni and Omni bags.

 1. Complete your didactic classes - these can be at the grad or undergrad level in an accredited program.

2. Complete a Masters degree - if your undergrad does not provide a DPD statement, youll want to look for grad programs that will. I know the CSU program does because thats what I did. When I was looking (In 2016, before the masters requirement) there were less than a dozen programs that allowed you to get a masters to complete the DPD without a BS for. A DPD program. That might be different now, do some research. 

3. Complete a dietetic internship 1200 hours of supervised practice food service, clinical, and community nutrition. Some masters programs are Coordinated programs meaning you do your masters and DI through the same program. But many interns go through DICAS, a computer matching program. a few internships are paid, most are not. You can do full or part time, and some programs are Distance programs meaning youre part of a program but find your own preceptors in any location that works for you. Coordinated programs have the benefit hat youre still a student, so can take student loans/get scholarships, whereas if you go through DICAS, you typically graduate first.

Its much more important to be compassionate as a dietitian than a brainiac.","6"

"SoColdInAlaska",4,4,"I don't really have enough information to say- does patient still have AKI? what is eGFR? What are estimated protein needs? Is he at risk of skin breakdown?

My initial thought is suspicious of Jevity intolerance, the fiber content is similar to Nepro and the osmolality is lower- was there a med change, a GI issue, a positioning issue at this time? That said, Jevity does have about double the FOS fiber as Nepro so an intolerance to that is possible. 

Also would consider Suplena depending on protein needs if patient does have CKD to not exacerbate renal issues. However, if a standard formula is appropriate/protein needs are within range for osmolite, say, there's no reason not to try it, he's just at risk of constipation, so I would monitor for that.","1"

Since ultimately there's only so many options and so many ways to go about this, I think you can probably go in a couple directions:

1. trial Suplena if it is possible to give 100% of nutrition during day when resident is upright and well-positioned. you can always supplement extra fluid overnight via pump to control total volume via bolus.

2. trial Osmolite if standard formula is desired. monitor for constipation (may need fiber supplement) and trend renal labs to ensure lower protein isn't indicated.

3. If Nepro is well-tolerated and still meets needs after acute stay, see if this can be justified based on renal history and elevated protein needs for reasons you mentioned?","1_1_1"

I think the idea of being an RD specialist vs generalist may look different in the clinical setting, especially inpatient vs outpatient, which would also be so different when comparing to counseling-focused health/wellness roles and other areas. 

As someone who transitioned from adults to peds (adult level 1 trauma center acute/critical care role to peds inpatient nutrition support focused role) there are SO many differences, it feels like two completely different worlds. I thought it would be much more of a lateral transition and instead felt I was completely starting over, despite already being very experienced with EN/PN, having my CNSC, coming from a strong internship, etc. I had no idea it was so different until doing it. The skills are absolutely translatable and intertwined, but it is a completely different knowledge base. 

The longer Ive been an RD, the more Ive come to realize there is way too much to know to be an effective jack of all trades, at least in the inpatient world and I think both of my employers (both large academic institutions) want specialist RDs who are extremely knowledgeable in one area but can also cover other areas with acceptable level of knowledge (and also open to training, etc). Physicians (and also AI) are able to look up the basics and generalist concepts quickly. Is it the same? No, but a specific and advanced skill set will set you apart.","5"

I have a few that have opted for monthly since we know they will only get a few sessions covered. 

I also have been encouraging my patients to reach out to their insurance and see what they are covered for. I position this as a good way for us to create our approach to our future sessions. Everyone i have asked has been open to this, and most report back what their coverage is without me asking. 

As for my follow-ups, I gear the first half of my session towards catching up, talking wins/challenges, talking about existing goals, and creating new goals. Second half i will focus on some kind of education piece and scheduling follow-ups. This usually easily fills the 53 min minimum for insurance billing.

Otherwise, insurances will try to fight it, but I have had success getting elecare jr covered when vivonex proved insufficient for long-term use (EFAD and needed a 1.5 kcal formula). The reason insurance initially rejected the claim was because pediatric formula was being prescribed to an adult. 

If elecare jr/ neocate jr/ neocate splash etc are insufficient in protein, you could consider essential care jr, which is higher in fat that vivonex and higher in protein than the other pediatric elemental formulas. 

Anecdotally, some have had success adding 5-10 mL, 2-3x a day, safflower oil flushes (followed by a water flush), but that was not well tolerated from my experiences. Oil does not mix well separates quickly in a feed bag, so mixing the two does not work for continuous feeding.","5"

Also this still bugs me to this day. He had me make a 30 day menu for Jewish clients that were Kosher and it had to follow the  government guidelines . Apparently. Cant have milk with certain things ir Prk or shell fish. I read the text & 

So on meals that had specific items I didnt add milk. I submitted my work and he goes  where is the milk. It has to follow gov guidelines cause this is a government program. Then I said  okay Ill fix it. So I fix it. Then this a-hole goes  you cant put milk with this cause now it is not kosher like are you effing with me??? Then he just did it for me then had milk powder in meals that was not supposed to be mixed with specific things that were kosher. 

To make it worse he made it seem like I was a horrible intern when I showed up daily, asked for work , did everything he asked then he tried to tell me to work from home& never sent me work to day but wanted me to fudge my 8 week internship and do nothing but would sign my hours so I complained after not hearing from him in 2 weeks . Then he tried to say that he thought my internship for community was 4 weeks and my preceptor knew that was complete BS cause he agreed to take me for 8 weeks.

Was completely shocked when my next preceptors were genuinely excited to welcome me and gave me overall rave evals while also providing useful constructive criticism. 

I also didn't feel like I could be honest in my review of the bad preceptor since it would be obvious the review came from me (I was the only intern they had that year) and I couldn't risk that messing up my job opportunities there in future.

She was rude to me the whole rotation - she would tell me I'm doing to much or that my interventions were wrong - even though I had just completed extensive education on these topics on the graduate level! She hurt my spirit so much that it still stings 6 years later. Unfortunately for me, the college did NOT stand up for students.

"pollyatomic",3,3,"I can't help, but I got curious and looked up their listings on Indeed. I was disappointed to see that their salary range for mental health therapists is significantly higher than for dietitians, given that the educational requirements and responsibilities are quite similar- but the RDs are given higher caseloads (up to 80 patients for dietitians and 30-40 for therapists). If I were interviewing I might express concern, but that's easy for me to say since I'm in private practice and not looking for a job.

I haven't worked with them yet, but I get marketing/networking stuff from them all the time. I might reach out and let them know that the salary discrepancy sends the messages that dietitians are less valuable and skilled. Facilities are sometimes willing to listen to outpatient providers since we're often the ones sending them patients. I'll do my best to convince them they should pay their dietitians more :)

Good luck! If you do end up working there, I would love to hear how you like it.","1"

That said, they are doing a hiring blitz right now (I have friends who are RDs and peer mentors with equip) and are hiring 100 providers between now and July. They lowered the salary range for both RDs and Therapists for the blitz.

If you plan on doing food demonstrations at your current job site. You likely only need to set a date, sign up people, get equipment, and find a way to source/store food safely. I'd ask someone to help you with sign-ups and reminders. Most in-person cooking demos fail because people forget they signed up a month ago. Also, it's nice to take this off your plate so you can focus on the food demo and marketing.

How to identify those patients, you can start by a well thought out questionnaire,  maybe a good Google search can help you figure out the right questions. 

For example,  I had a mom who really wanted her adult son to eat more of a variety. Turns out when I asked him how important eating a variety was on a scale of 1-10 he said ""3"". They won't change what they don't want to change. So I asked him what he would like to work on instead.

If you are, the MNT should include fluid intake to increase urine volume mainly using water (there is some debate about filtered/mineral water effectiveness).

"SoColdInAlaska",3,3,"rats on no stone ID :( no, you don't want to restrict calcium, because calcium binds oxalate in the GI tract, so low calcium diet leads to greater oxalate absorption, and a low calcium diet means he'll just leech calcium from the bones anyways to increase blood values, so it'll get to the kidneys either way. This reference (Table 4) recommends calcium 1000-1200 mg daily and protein 0.8-1.0 g/kg but does admit the protein studies have been inconclusive.

Citrus fruits are great for preventing the environment that kidney stones are created in. These are all what I focus on first. There's usually plenty of nutrition education opportunities right there alone.

What sticks out to me the most is the sodium. High sodium diet results in increased calcium in the urine which creates stones.

I wouldn't reduce the protein, but check to see if the personal trainer recommended protein. I've seen personal trainers online recommend crazy amounts of protein. 

\--------

I know it is controversial, but I personally don't agree that reducing oxalates in the diet is the answer. I think oxalates are like cholesterol - when people had high cholesterol, dietary cholesterol got the blame which was found to be generally incorrect.

I wrote a literature review on sodium intake and kidney stones in grad school. I think that we shouldn't vilify whole foods like spinach and berries when someone is drinking minimal water, high soda intake, high meat/low plants, and high sodium processed food intake - there's so much work there to do first. Fruit and vegetables decrease pH in urine. I think stones are more of a urine pH and high sodium issue than an oxalate issue.  The acidity is caused by junk food which causes calcium to leach into the urine creating high calcium in urine which calcium binds to everything including oxalates.

"Ginseekingginger",1,1,"Interesting. 

I have to do all Section Ks, and Nutrition, Hydration, TF CAAs. 

Do you then have to re-evaluate if there is a change within the 7days after your assessment and before the ARD?

Ex: ARD is 3/8, your assessment is 3/3. On 3/7 diet is downgraded by SLP d/t choking incident. 
Do you do another note?","1_1"
"foodbringtome",1,1,"Info in your RD eval is used to complete the MDS, not the other way around. MDS is a very nuanced beast and completely separate from your evals.

The ARD marks the end of the 7 day review period for the MDS. The answer to the MDS questions need to be based on documentation from within those 7 days (ARD minus 6 days because the ARD counts as within the look back period). The full MDS needs to be completed by 14 days AFTER the ARD. You don't want to wait until day 14 to complete your section (the sooner you complete after ARD the better, of course), but that's just MDS scheduling.

Let's use your example: 

&gt;Ex: ARD is 3/8, your assessment is 3/3. On 3/7 diet is downgraded by SLP d/t choking incident. Do you do another note?

Starting on 3/9 you can complete Section K and triggering CAAs based on everything that's happened from 3/2 to 3/8 in all disciplines. This includes your own evals, SLP, nursing, any diet/texture changes, significant weight changes, anything relevant to Section K. In this instance you would mark ""Yes"" to the Section K question asking about mechanically altered diet, since the resident had a mechanically altered diet at some point within those 7 days. You would not redo your RD eval as long as the info that's in it was accurate at the time you signed it.

This is why I recommend my RDs complete their evals within the 7 days before ARD and update/sign the care plan at the time of their eval. It gets captured in the window that's needed for MDS completion.

Does your center have an MDS Coordinator role? They'd be a great resource for you. Or even discuss with your DON. They should have received specific training on MDS requirements. I've worked for LTC companies where the RD did Section K and triggering CAAs, but I've started seeing more of them transition to having a designated MDS Coordinator role that's responsible for all things MDS.","1_1_1"
"Ginseekingginger",1,1,"Hmm. I see what youre saying. And Im seeing it from both ways now.

But the MDS is based on interview/observation as well, not just record review. And if the RD assessment/quarterly is on the ARD and obviously reflects the previous months and notes anything specific that happened in those 7 day look back, then how is that wrong?

Ive always done section K, and most LTC buildings with an RD (at least here in Michigan) usually do section K.
And since Im doing it, I sort of consider my assessment going hand and hand in conjunction with what Im coding and doing CAAs for. 

We have two MDS coordinators. And they frequently say that my assessment should reflect the MdS coding so that I can refer to it for further explanation of why I coded things. So if I did my assessment days before the ARD and on the ARD day there is some new issue, I would need to have some documentation to explain it and address it. Because with annuals and sig changes you do the CAAs to determine care planning needs. 

I think thats why I wanted to know what everyone does. Because there is no written standard of practice on how it should be done. There is nothing on the SOM about it specific to our Nutrition assessments.

I surveyed nursing homes for 9 years and saw it being done so many different ways. So I guess as long as the assessment is resulting in quality care then thats all the matters.","1_1_1_1"
"foodbringtome",2,2,"Oh, completing the RD assessment on the ARD isnt wrong from a compliance standpoint, since the ARD is part of the 7 day look back. Could the feedback youre getting be a preference, or direction that theyve received? Is there any regional support you can tap into for clarification? I cant rationalize their thought process, unfortunately, so I totally understand why youre questioning this.

Any time a notable change happens it should be documented in their EMR anyway. So if a new issue happens between your assessment and the Section K completion, thats the documentation you reference. Even if its not your own. If the new issue is something you only noticed during your MDS-related interview/observation, then it can be added into the relevant CAA.

Im realizing your post was just asking how others do it. That was my process when I did Section K, and the direction Ive given to RDs and we havent run into issues with it. I hope this helps!","1_1_1_1_1"

There's no reason the J Tube shouldn't be replaced so long as the stoma is not infected. 

PN for this patient, if she is well nourished presently, should only be considered if it is estimated that she cannot be fed enterally for &gt;7 days, per ASPEN criteria. Of course, multiple hospitals against PN is in your favor, not hers. 

Probably already on your mind, but would also start thiamine if she has been/will be without nutrition for &gt;48 hours so as to not intensify any confusion.

I have had patients - and patient family members/caregivers - like this and know it is really challenging on our end too. But it is important IMO to continue positive regard for the patient and their lived experience in order to work together towards a good outcome beyond discharge. Possibly approaching the psych referral with acknowledging their complex medical issues and a need for additional support could be helpful. I don't see an indication for TPN here. I can imagine TPN may sound like a great solution to someone who doesn't know the risks or feels they have exhausted other options. I wonder if this patient has someone on their long term care team - like their GI doc or APP - that they have rapport with and who communicate some of this with them. It is hard coming in as the dietitian in a situation like this when it sounds like it's been going on for a long time!","3_1"
"Educational_Tea_7571",7,7,"Absolutely agree with a provider that has a good report. With complex GI patients and a pych hx it gets really difficult. Yes, they can be "" manipulative"" but they also often do have medical trauma. Having both a psych person and an advocate can help with communication. TPN is indicated, but the patient also needs to be met where they are at. Psych illness is still an illness.  It is hard as an RD when you have a functioning gut and you know the risks, but what is worse, no feeding?

"FantasticSign7472",1,1,"Update: I appreciate all of your input greatly. As many of you pointed out, Munchhausens is at the top of our list of concerns here. Shes on probation for Munchhausen by proxy for faking symptoms of her infant and having a G-tube placed. The history is very significant. Most of her diagnoses are self entered into the EMR system with no true diagnosis per her insurance case manager. Throughout her hospitalization with us, she has tried manipulating all of her providers with a lot of, he said, she said TPN is indicated lies. We had a team meeting with her where we all told her that we would not be pursuing TPN. Shes claiming that she has an initial G.I. appointment with a new provider next month and TPN as a bridge to that appointment. Instead, I offered her NJ and of course she refused. Shes been refusing psych since admission, but social work told her today that it is a condition of her parole to comply with psych. Now shes requesting transfer. 

Heres my question. Shes refusing all of the options that we are giving her, and cant tolerate oral feeds per her report. Do we discharge and say that she denied medical intervention, or are we going to have to offer TPN if she continues to deny?

The goal isn't weight loss in children, it's weight maintenance until they grow taller. Make sure you have charted all pediatric patients on a WHO or CDC growth chart before you assess them for weight or growth concerns. You should know percentiles. At 9 years old, you should be able to assess what the kid says is going on. Encourage whole foods and mindful eating (eat when hungry, stop when full). Water over liquid calories. And the back bone of all this is definitely the Ellen Satter method. Mom needs to offer healthy foods and then let the child worry about if they will eat or how much. She should not be overly concerned about what the child is eating outside the home as this can cause issues. If the kid is having emotional hunger or mental health issues, there may be a referral in there.","1"
"Meeno722",7,7,"I agree with everything said here! The only time we get the school involved to limit food is when kids have cognitive disabilities. If Mom is concerned with the quality of foods offered that's a different story, and may be worth looking into. If that's not the case then overpolicing food intake should be avoided.","1_1"
"LibertyJubilee",3,3,"Thank you very much, your response has been so helpful.  I have received a referral from her doctor who has charted her in the 95th percentile. My struggle with this 9 year old, is there has been lying about food intake and so I can't accurately assess what is really going on. My first session was with mom and child. I felt the child was embarrassed (my observation) and she kept trying to derail the conversation with distractions, any kind of focus was not there. I don't think she is presenting like a normal 9 year old, but more like how a 5 year old would present. So mom and I did the second session just us where I found she went extreme on the goals.

I do think the child had a lot of ""food noise"" going on and I do understand that restrictions are not the right way to go. And I think you're right, that this may be a case I will need to refer out. The more I am understanding about her situation the more I am seeing she is not necessarily a typical case of selective eating.","1_2"
"JustARedditBrowser",3,3,"I think you need to do sessions without mom there with the child and try to build a rapport. Honestly, everything youve described of the mom has a lot of red flags for potential food restriction or other things that may just be escalating her concerns about weight even more. 

I highly recommend the Ellyn Satter model. Over involvement of parent with child food intake leads to negative consequences down the road for the child. Disordered eating or full blown eating disorders. As others mentioned, weight loss is not the goal but maintenance.

One thing to note for parents when working on the Satter method is that things may get worse before they get better. It wont be until the child trusts that the parent will stop interfering so much that they will be able to start regulating themselves. Patience is needed.","1_2_1"
"MysteriousHoney7179",1,1,"Has the child undergone a psych evaluation?

"RD_Michelle",44,44,"Are you familiar with Ellyn Satter and the division of responsibility?  In a nutshell, parents determine (when kid is not at school) what foods are being offered/served, when meal and snack times are, and where meals are being eaten (preferably at kitchen table with no distractions). Kid decides if they want to eat at all/all or none of the food offered (or somewhere in the middle), and how much or how little to eat (obviously with ED patients it's different, if they're not eating at all with anorexia, then they lose that right for awhile until stabilized).

Do not put this kid on a calorie count/calorie restriction - that can backfire big time. It can cause kids to sneak/hide food. Maybe the kid is not getting enough to eat in the morning at home and is still hungry when they get to school. Or maybe the school is offering foods that the patient isn't allowed to eat at home (overly restrictive) and the kid is eating because they don't have a chance to eat those types of foods outside of school. Focus on the things that can be controlled: cut out sugary non-nutritive caloric beverages like soda and juice if those are being consumed. Don't allow grazing at home, and have set snack times (ie 1 snack after school and maybe a small snack/treat in the evening), and designated dinner time.","2"
"LibertyJubilee",4,4,"Thank you for your answer. This is lengthy so I appreciate you reading it. I'm familiar with the division of responsibility and I did mention this to her mom. I also discouraged her mom from a caloric restriction, however I think it would be helpful to see what she is actually eating at school to see if there is an excessive intake. Which led me to ask the question about, how much is actually too much. Where did those 11 pounds come from? So the calories would be more for information to figure out what is going on vs actually putting her on a caloric restriction. 

I do not think she has an ED currently, but I can see she could easily develop one in the future. She has been telling her mom that she wants to lose weight because she doesn't want to be picked on at school and she has been lying about her intake. 

Her mom used to keep a snack cart of basically junk food in the house. She has since replaced it with healthier options like fruit and yogurt which her child won't touch. So I have given her a handout of 100 snacks the child can select the snacks she actually would like to eat vs mom just putting fruit in her face and telling her that's her only snack option. She went from eating snacks almost all day and not eating dinner, to being restricted from all snacks at home. This wasn't a goal we had set in our last session (This was my second session with her mom). So part of my struggle is getting through to mom how to impliment gentle change.","2_1"

That's how I feel about these dyes. *I've* never had an issue consuming them and don't think most people do, but *some* people might, and they aren't *necessary*(*), so why not get rid of it just to limit unnecessary exposures?

So from a health and nutrition perspective, I'm ""meh-to-positive"" about it. But I am concerned about the optics. We don't typically **ban** things unless we have *lots* of evidence they are harmful (see the fight over trans fats), and we aren't even willing to ban alcohol or cigarettes. So why ban these dyes? It sends a message they are very harmful, and I don't believe there's evidence to support this level of response. So I do worry about how this move optically feeds into the already problematic distrust of science, public health, regulation, etc. But there's only so much that can be done about that, tbh.

( * - Did y'all do an experiment in your food science class where you had flavored beverages with no color or ""the wrong color"" for the flavor? Like, we had a bunch of clear beverages that were flavored like different fruit and we had to guess the flavor, and it was *so* hard without the color cue to prompt us that the red one *does* taste like cherry, the orange one *does* taste like orange, etc.; color *does* feed into our food/drink experiences.

Another suggestion - maybe talk about adding in nutritious foods first so they can slowly change their taste buds. Add in some fresh fruit, one type of veg they don't normally eat or trying different types of whole grain breads vs white bread. And just do one thing at a time. It's a longer journey of course but they may need very baby steps. And the thought of adding vs taking away at first may help. Eventually more of those good things can replace the unhealthy things. 

The next step could be - eliminate one unhealthy thing from your diet. Maybe it's soda, or fried foods, or donuts (whatever they eat a lot of that is a problem) - change nothing else and just focus on eliminating that one type of food and add in a healthier alternative and go from there.

Its got to come from inside them. If theyre not ready, theyre not ready. Its not on you to make them ready. Dont put so much pressure on yourself. Offer them what you have to offer and then dont worry about it anymore. Its up to them.

How about pre-portioned/frozen meals? You can still technically lose weight eating fast food or whatever else as long as youre in a calorie deficit. Maybe focus on that.

"megatronrollout",2,2,"Your post may be more of a vent than asking for input, but I also work in weight management and bariatrics and had some thoughts to hopefully help.  Here is my 2¢, if you choose to read it:

I try to meet people where they're at, if they won't cook, ask them what they will do and make suggestions from there.  And/or offer non cooking options (Lean Cuisines with all food groups,.I e. not Mac in cheese, or a homemade adult lunchable/snackle box situation where they just add basic ingredients into a balanced meal) where at least they won't be eating out.  Also, frozen options: microwave or air fryer streamable veggies or precooked meats, etc.  

But also, doubling down on some of what others have said, you can only do so much before it falls on them to take action (""lead a horse to water"" comment).  A patient once told me that she realized that no one on a white horse was coming to save her, and that she was the only one who could make the change. 

Unfortunately, not everyone is going to be in that mindset from the get go.  And I know you said you have trepidation about hurting anyone's feelings, but sometimes a blunt statement is needed.  It doesn't need to be judgmental, just factual, ""if you want to see change in your body/on the scale (etc), you need to make changes in what you're currently doing. . .these are the things that are going to get you there, what you do with that information is up to you"".  Verbally put the onus on them instead of speaking in hypotheticals or in generalities (""weight loss requires XYZ"" vs ""if YOU want to see change in YOUR body, YOU need to do XYZ"")

Sure, we can talk all day, but in communities where theres already some distrust of medical providers, words can only go so far. So letting them actually see what theyre intaking and the impact it has is helpful.  Not like fear mongering but..

You want to try a detox or restrictive diet? Lets revisit your body comp, remember how your metabolism dropped because you lost muscle?
Youre reaching for that 8 oz ribeye? Heres what 3 oz of it looks like in fat, maybe that explains the cholesterol bump and your weight loss stall.


I always remind folks: Its not my job to tell you what to do. Its my job to let you know your options. You get to decide what path you want to take.

That includes talking about bariatric or medical weight loss surgery. I know it makes people uncomfortable, but when were dealing with metabolic resistance, its not fairor ethicalto pretend nutrition alone is always enough. Im here to advocate for you, not just tell you what you want to hear.

And if someones not ready? Thats okay too. I end the session with an open door. Youre welcome back whenever youre ready to get started. Because ultimately, its about them, on their terms, in their time.","21"

Occasionally people wont engage with this, but its more common for people in my office to pick a goal or at least state a topic they were interested in.

Please consider ""neglect"" to be included with acts of harm. What happens when there isn't the high quality care a licensed dietitian can bring? Patients are ignored. They lose more weight in nursing homes. An anemic pregnant woman needs a blood transfusion because no one counseled her on iron deficiency. No one is documenting the effects of neglect! So does that mean it didn't happen?

Ofc this does NOT stand for everyone, there's always a ton of people with chronic issues who see a hospital stay as nothing more than a bump in the road, but I see far fewer people who want to tell me about nutrition than I did when I did outpatient counseling. and ICU in particular can take the counseling and education out of it, since it's so nutrition support forward.","11"

I still keep lab type jackets as part of my uniform and wear scrubs now that I switched positions, scrubs are more comfortable,  and I can take the jacket off/ on  according to needs.

I ended up choosing a health coaching program to enhance my motivational interviewing skills. It's the Vanderbilt health coaching program if you were curious.

When researching programs, ask them if they have scholarships or TA/RA positions for their program and what percentage of students in the program are given the packages.

I worked throughout undergrad and the internship as an autism therapist to pay my personal expenses. It was similar to in home tutoring targeting behavior and learning so my families were flexible to work with my schedule as long as their kids were getting the care and plan hours they needed. I had a bit of financial aid in the form of scholarships and grants. My director at UNLV actually recommended taking out a student loan senior year and pocketing it to use on the internship so I did. Graduated in December 2014. I took out enough in a single student loan that fall semester to pay the internship fees, buy any materials I needed, and have a little cushion in my savings account ($500) while I underwent that journey. I entered the workforce as an RDN in September 2015 with under $5K in student loan debt that I repaid within my first 2 years only because I was reckless with my new found adult money and minimal living expenses at 25 (I traveled, ate at Vegas restaurants with friends and had amazing experiences I had never been able to afford myself up until that point.

My dad enlisted, married my mom and had my sister at 19 (1981-82) and retired from active duty at 46 (once I graduated high school in 2008).

I had about 52 full time credits from previously going to college years ago that transferred to my degree program in nutrition, and I worked nearly full time, gave up living on my own to move in with mom and I paid cash for my last 2.5 years of study (I paid about 16k out of pocket for 2 full time fall semesters, 2 full time spring semesters, and 3 accelerated summer courses).  I completed this before the US Masters requirements took effect so that I didnt have to also pay for that right away. 

My distance internship tuition was 12k plus expenses like transportation, supples and books (probably close to 15k all in).  I got married between finishing my degree and starting my internship, my husband gifted me a deposit on the tuition for the internship, and then thankfully I received a 10k scholarship from the academy foundation, so we probably net spent about 5k during those 10 months.  The hard part was because of the travel time and hours, I was no longer able to work at all at that time.  I passed my exam about a month after my internship wrapped up, and I landed a job a month after that.  

Its definitely not an easy path, and in total, I spent around 21k to finish and get my RD credential, even having already completed basically 2 years of undergrad prior that was transferable.

"Ok-Industry858",20,20,"I will usually start tapering TPN as oral/enteral intakes improve I.e., once theyre meeting ~25% of needs, decrease PN to provide ~75%, 50%/50%, and then once theyre at 75% I discontinue TPN. 

Given that this patient is on a diet as tolerated (so I am assuming that their gut is functional) but not eating adequately, I highly recommend advocating for enteral feeds, whether that is via NG or G or GJ tube. overfeeding (including to promote weight gain) with TPN is not recommended due to the significant risk of hepatic dysfunction including hepatic steatosis (in addition to the myriad of other risks associated with TPN of course)","1"
"Ok-Industry858",6,6,"Also to add to this, given how long this patient has been on TPN, if enteral feeds are not feasible, I highly recommend transitioning to a cycled PN schedule, in addition to having bloodwork weekly including LFTs and Triglycerides if this hasnt been done already. 

Depending on what kind of TPN your facility uses (idk if its 3-in-1 or 2-in-1) but if its a custom PN rather than standard core solutions/orders, you could potentially take whatever you have right now and x0.75, x0.5, and then keep the same rate so that it is administered over 18 hours to provide 75% or 12 hours to provide 50%.","1_1"
"SoColdInAlaska",4,4,"You can keep it simple- reduce your rate at the rate the calories are going up orally. Might need to check trays or do a formal calorie count to help. If you're confident she's getting 25% kcal orally, reduce tpn by so much. Is she on solids or a liquid diet? And even on a solid diet, is she favoring non protein calories? If this is the case, you may want to pull your non protein calories from tpn first. 

I would be cautious about cycling tpn in someone who's bmi is 13 if you're running a high enough rate for weight gain, because you may run into problems with her glucose infusion rate going too high. This will be less of a problem when you are only giving her 50% of her needs via TPN, so you can always change to a 12-14 hour cycle at that point.

People are told to know their value and not take less than they are worth, but large numbers of us (not just RDs, this goes for all positions in all fields) are in a position like you mention. ""Beggars can't be choosers"" as they say. 

If we could *all* agree to not take those lowball offers then, in theory, they'd have to start offering more.  But unless 100% of us do that, it will instead mean that people who accept lowball offers get (underpaid) jobs while those who are holding out for better pay are not hired. This *could* even end up in those people becoming more desperate as they go longer without a fair wage, and then they become those people wiling to take the low-ball offers.  Because this is the way of the world and employers know this, *can* we actually cause market shift by holding out for higher offers?

Further, if we envision a field where the most desperate are the only ones taking the lowball offers, while those who can afford to pass on poor wages do so until something better is on the table, we also perpetuate existing disparities in which those worst-off take the worse jobs due to desperation while those already in a better position can likely obtain better positions as a result.

I suppose it may all just boil down to ""capitalism sucks,"" but I'm curious if anyone has any perspectives on this that might hone my own?","3_3"

To say its just negotiation skills or to put blame on the person is a bit dense. I think the objective of this thread is that the starting offer should be appropriate to our education and skills. We shouldnt have to be negotiating for a just pay. Negotiation should be more about I hear your offer, but I also have value here. We shouldnt have to be fighting for the minimum.","3_4_2"

As a manager who advocates for higher pay for RDs, I am mixed about posts like these because they lack context based on location and industry.","4"
"Veg-travel",-4,-4,"The RD clinical jobs have not kept up because people keep taking low pay. The figures I offered are based on my actual pay for the past 15 years, which never goes up anymore mostly in hospitals, public health, LTC etc, in a below average COL medium cities in Texas and other southwest cities. This is why I suggested in my OP that people look up the Federal pay scale for dietitians. Federal RD pay is more realistic and available for anyone to look at.  

Another unpopular opinion is  that the clinical RD generalist  job will be replaced by others less qualified (already seen this happening) or even AI  soon, since so many will  write a note in the chart and hide in their office. RD generalist are not very useful IMHO, there is too much to know. RD's need to specialize find a niche and be forward facing to be valuable.","4_1"

"Dangerous_Ad_360",3,3,"I missed the deleted comment, however, I dont think we can base pay recommendations of any one given person.  
Heres an example, lets just take NY State.
NY pay for RDs varies tremendously throughout the state based on city vs upstate vs rural areas, as does the CoL here. 
Blanket pay rates are not something hospital administration will entertain, theyll say, why are you comparing this facility to NYC facilities, when we are in upstate NY and the CoL isnt comparable.     

My advice (no one asked, but here it is): negotiate your pay.  Advocate for yourself.  Try to negotiate up during the hiring process.  When RDs do that, it helps increase wages because the employer both needs and wants to maintain the internal equity of the employees they already have.

If you want to make more money, ask, how can I get there?  Certification?  Go do it.  Ask them to pay.

Wages, in my opinion, are a supply and demand issue.  Too many RDs were in supply about 10 years ago.. that has changed and its pushing up wages - its happening now.  When less go into the field, the ones remaining will be fewer and therefore will need to be paid more as employers compete for the same employees, driving up wages.  As the pay rises, more will want to become an RD again..  think of nurses during Covid.. major supply and demand issue.. wages increased dramatically..","4_1_1_1_1"

"mar621",1,1,"AI is a powerful tool that can be used by RDs when charting because there is so much to know. It can pick up things we miss. It can often create better POCs that a human can. This doesnt mean AI will replace these roles but I think become a powerful tool for us.  Do you really want to keep writing long notes from scratch? This is why RDs stay in offices because if they were out and about they would never complete their notes timely. With AI, we can get ahead and spend more time with patients &amp; less time charting.

"garden_fox_",5,5,"Not to mention, it's a wild take to recommend *switching careers* and presumably going *further into debt* for PA school because you weren't offered ""enough"" at an RD position.

ETA: And I do agree that overall RDs are underpaid, but most are not in the position to decline a low offer, especially as a new grad. Most hospital systems will not budge on starting salary, or at least not enough to really matter. I remember being offered such a low hourly rate at my first job, and when I tried to negotiate, I was told they had zero room for negotiation. So I took it because I needed a job. I worked that job for a few years, gained experience, and then moved on to a new position where I was making considerably more.

It sucks that we aren't valued better and paid more, but just declining offers doesn't do anything, or at least not quickly enough. If hospitals couldn't hire ANYONE, because everyone was declining offers, then yes, I think something would have to change. But still, that takes time. These things take forever to get approved, and all of those entry-level RDs would be jobless in the interim. So I guess what I'm getting at is that I understand your frustration, but the blame shouldn't be put on RDs taking job offers because they need to survive, ya know? And pivoting to a different career that requires more schooling and more debt certainly isn't the answer for everyone.","7_1_2_1"

Several times now, Ive turned down RD jobs that didnt offer what I was asking, and I watched those organizations struggle to fill the position. Those same roles were then advertised a few months later at a higher rate. Sometimes it really just takes being able to walk away from the table and go back when the other side comes to their senses.
