I sometimes cook rice for my meals and sometimes noodles. It's like a 50-50 situation because it's simply more convenient. But almost everyone I know says to not eat noodles everyday. But when I eat noodles, I cook some meat, eggs, and vegetables to pair with it, not just noodles on it's own. I'm basically substituting noodles for rice.",14

"HowToEverythingYT",5,5,"How bad is sugar free gum for you?","Okay, a little backstory: I used to absolutely love chewing gum (sugar free of course) but I stopped a few weeks ago after finding out the devastating effects artificial sweeteners have on the gut microbe and liver.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am wondering, how bad actually is it for such a small product like sugar free gum - how bad is it for your gut, liver and etc to have 2-4 pieces of gum a day? Is it negligible or something that should be stopped to benefit your health? The main brands of gum I eat is extra and mentos by the way if that makes any difference.

"avt2020",29,29,"I've been back at eating much healthier and wow I feel such a big difference","I don't even care of part of it could be a placebo or whatever but I feel pretty good. Not like jumping up and down amazing, but I feel more like a normal person. 

I have PTSD, anxiety, depression and it makes it hard to function each day because of the incredible fatigue I've always felt but after my honeymoon, I decided to start eating better again. 

I had to file bankruptcy earlier last month and felt so embarrassed by it, I gained 20 pounds over a couple months. Finally now that I'm married and things have settled down I decided I'd eat better like I did in college. 

Just by adding flaxseed to my diet along with my fiber gummies (10g a day plus the 8g of flaxseed minimum) has made my GI problems almost disappear! I'm not nearly as bloated, I don't have as much trapped gas or cramps. I've never been so happy to not have diarrhea anymore either or going to the bathroom constantly! It's great. 

When I was younger I was overweight and I just ended up starving myself by having soda in the morning to suppress my appetite, a bag of chips in the afternoon, and dinner at home. I've definitely carried a lot of those bad habits into my young adulthood, but I just turned 25 a couple days ago. I feel way too old to be feeling this way about food when I genuinely love fruit and vegetables. 

I've been watching a lot of healthy minded YouTubers which helps because I wish I knew how to have a better relationship with food than I do. 

Today I was so proud of myself, I went to pick up the rest of our groceries at Sam's and I got some delicious free samples. I got to order a frozen yogurt and I got a soda for my husband. I had a little bit of soda and was not tempted to drink all of it. I also stopped eating my frozen yogurt when I was full and didn't want anymore. 

I even got some treats today and I haven't been tempted to eat them all- I had a couple pieces but after I didn't want anymore I stopped! I feel like I can truly enjoy food and not feel miserable after eating. 

I'm really hoping I can keep it up.",6

"Sea_shanty_2",5,5,"Trying to improve my diet as a picky eater","Hey everyone. I'm 27m, 5'11"", and weigh roughly 300lbs after years of binge eating. About two weeks ago I started dieting to lose weight and improve my health in general. I'm doing 18/6 intermittent fasting with two meals a day and I try not to snack inbetween. I've been aiming for approximately 1300-1500 calories a day.

One of my biggest problems is that for my whole life my diet has been very limited, and it's not really healthy. I'm working on trying new foods, but I've not had very much success. Here's what my current diet looks like:

Lunch: I find it easier to simply have a selection of smaller snacks for lunch. I pretty much eat the same few things each day. These are:

- A couple of breadsticks with cream cheese

- Some rice crackers or seeded flatbread

- A salami stick

- Babybel mini cheese wheel

- A small bag of crisps (chips)

- A tangerine

This adds up to around 500-550 calories.

Dinner: For dinner I've been having either a pizza or just chicken and chips (fries).

Aside from the foods mentioned above, I'm also okay with yoghurts, raspberries, strawberries, most breakfast cereals. The only vegetable I've found that I'm okay with is spinach.

"BorakCrimson",4,4,"IF, healthy eating, exercise and their effects on libido","I am 37 years old, male, very skinny with a big belly. Father had type 2 diabetes. Used to eat anbag of chips, chocolate every night and didn't have much physical activity.

Began to exercise and IF 2 months ago. I consume no bread, sugar or highly processed food. Only pasta and rice with a minimal amount. Try to eat high amounts of vegetable, pulses, egg and meat. Don't count my calories but eat until I am full between 12:00-20:00. I don't restrict my fat intake and use butter and olive oil as much as I want in my meals. Walking everyday for an hour and pull up, push up, squad every other day to failure. Getting multivitamins, vit d supplement and whey shake on my exercise days.

I feel healthier overall but: I had 2 vacations during this time period. In my vacation I'd let myself eat my forbidden foods and consumed junk food such as McDonald's, waffle and icecream etc. And I was surprised that all these days my libido has increased greatly. Now, compared to those days I feel like I have much lower libido. In terms of erectyle function, I can't say that there is much difference but I think of sex or crave for it much much less compared to 2 months ago and those vacation days. Is that normal? Is it because of lower calorie intake maybe? I have tried to eat more but it is really very difficult to eat more of whole foods as they make me feel full very quickly.

"me_gusta_helado",14,14,"Cookies and candy make up over half of my daily caloric intake","So I was looking through my entries in MyFitnessPal and I think I finally realized what my problem is. I eat 1000-1500 calories worth of desserts every day.

I've been trying to cut calories but I keep ending up very hungry after getting to my 2200 calorie daily intake goal. I realized that if I cut out this ridiculously large amount of desserts, I could have tons more room for foods that actually would fill me up and make me feel full and still stay under my goal. But what I don't know is how I get rid of the desserts. I've been packing healthier desserts in my lunch like 100 calorie low sugar cookie packs or other similar small items. However, after eating what I allocated for myself, I'll end up eating a ton more in one of three ways:

- My work sometimes has free cookies and candy in the break room
- I'll go to a grocery store or gas station to buy some
- If I'm at home, I'll just sit in my pantry and keep eating more and more cookies

I have basically zero self control when it comes to cookies. This is obviously a huge problem and I don't even know where to begin. My breakfast, lunch, and dinner are quite healthy and are usually things like plain yogurt, fruit, vegetables, hummus, raw nuts, seeds, and etc. but the desserts are obviously the issue. I just want to have the small quantity that I pack for myself after each meal instead of adding in tons of other stuff. Can anyone please give me some advice here?",12

After the surgery i wasn't allowed to eat at all for a few hours, and later was encouraged to try eating some yogurt. I did but it really hurt so i ended up only eating very little. 
side note I'm very used to pain and assumed no amount of medication would get rid of it completely until i heeled, just got home, took my normal dosage of pain killers for when i get headaches (the high but safe option on the pack, it says one or two and i always take two because one isn't enough) turns out i was wrong and you can be mostly pain free after surgery if you just take the right amount of pain meds for your pain. Anyways I'm mentioning this because evidently i ate very little even when i was allowed to eat because it really hurt to swallow.
Anyway, two days after the surgery i had a bleed and was no longer allowed to eat or drink for two days, and when i started, once again i ate very very little and drank very little too. 
Basically I've had two days where i ate probably twenty grams of food overall, two days of fasting with IV, and two days where i ate maybe 200-300 grams of food. 
I got home today and took my pain medication, as mentioned the amount i usually take, and it didn't hurt to swallow, at least not to much. I stuck to what the doctor said and only ate soft, mushed food in room temperature or colder, but i ate much much more that i did the previous six day. Still not close to the normal amount i eat usually or anyone does. (I ate a single pack of ramen noodles that i turned into mush and a piece of bread that i chewed thoroughly). 
My stomach has been gurgling for the past week non stop, so i thought that being able to eat more would help, but i guess i over did it because i got really bad acid reflux and a bit came up. So obviously i need to slow down about making my diet normal again, but at the same time im still super hungry.
If i dont eat my stomach hurts, and if i do it does too. I dont know what to do. Any tips on how to slowly get used to eating normal amounts of food without starving in the meantime?

"Lewis126",4,4,"Low Cholesterol Diet For Your Heart"," The food that we eat and the way we cook it, affects our bodies in more ways than one. Consuming high fat and high cholesterol foods, result in the development of atherosclerosis (thickening of the arteries), hypertension (elevated blood pressure levels), and cardiac diseases.

The case is further worsened if the individual has a sedentary lifestyle and is constantly bombarded with stress and emotional upheavals.

Eating correctly goes a long way in keeping the cholesterol levels in check and thus contributing to a healthy and strong heart.

Low fat and low cal recipes do not mean tasteless, unsavory, and bland food. With a little bit of time and patience, you can dish up delicious and exciting meals that will keep your heart and your taste buds happy!

Also, of particular importance, is the way in which the food is cooked. Methods like steaming, pressure-cooking, and stir-frying are very good techniques of cooking food, since they involve the use of little or no fat. Boiling vegetables and lean meat preserves the texture, color, and the flavor exceedingly well, and does not utilize any fat at all. Avoid boiling for long periods of time though. Likewise, pressure-cooking reduces the cooking time, and thus prevents the loss of valuable nutrients. Stir-frying utilizes very little medium. Opting for olive oil as the cooking medium, is prudent and significantly beneficial.

If you choose the right ingredients and the optimum method of cooking, you could enjoy an array of dishes, without feeling guilty or inflicting harm on yourself. So, go ahead, indulge yourself in some wholesome, low cal cooking. Bon appetite!",2

"tdellaringa",14,14,"Problematic palette has dogged my whole life. I now have elevated BP and Cholesterol and am struggling to build out a healthy menu. I could really use some help.","I will keep the background here as short as possible. I'm 56 and a [supertaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster) my whole life - that means I have real trouble with bitter foods and many food textures.

In my life I have twice lost 40-50 pounds and gotten in great shape. Covid wrecked my routine and I have put 30 back on. I knew my physical would be bad this year (been 2+ years since at the doc) and yep, high blood pressure and cholesterol. I need to fix this - again.

Assume I know all the basics of eating well. I've been through this before. I know how to shop, I know how to cook. My problem is finding enough things I can eat that I can actually keep in my mouth. It's embarrassing, but with many things I am like a child - I will literally gag on certain foods. It sucks. 

The core of my eating plan are things like grilled chicken/turkey, oatmeal/cheerios, apples, spinach and tomato salad (almost the only green thing I can eat), eggs, sweet potatoes, greek yogurt and some other fruits and nuts. I limit the bread and sometimes will have something like protein/keto pancakes. I'll often make flatbread pizza as a treat with chicken, etc. on it and go easy on the cheese. I drink seltzer water mostly, along with just water.

Most vegetables and all fish/seafood are 100% no-go for me. I have recently tried mashed cauliflower (Bird's Eye) and was actually able to eat that. I bought some riced cauliflower today, but no idea what to do with it.

This isn't broad enough, food wise. And a bit TMI, but lately when I try to get back to this, I get constipated (which didn't used to happen), which has its own issues. 

I need some additions to my meal plan to add variety so I can better stick to it and pull myself out of this. But I have this problem where my taste palette limits so much. I'm open to suggestions, I can't be the only guy in the world who faces this!",3

I am pleased to say now that my total cholesterol level is now 3.5! Which puts me in a much better position mentally, since I have always been one to worry about extreme scenarios like a heart attack or stroke.

"Londonmiller6",1,1,"Vitamin D supplements and their supporting role in bone health Has the pandemic had a negative effect on your outdoor life style?","Millions of people have spent more time indoors these past two years than ever. Due to spending more time indoors than in the past, people are lacking Vitamin D. The lack of vitamin D has been shown to cause bone weakness which can lead to osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and bone density decrease. Vitamin D, along with calcium, absorbs into the bones to promote strength and protection. Not getting enough vitamin D puts you at risk for many other diseases such as heart disease and high blood sugar as well. Finding a solution to this problem is of utmost priority, as bone density loss is a growing problem across the world.   Vitamin D is a hormone essential for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. A Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia in adults. Osteomalacia is softening of ones bones, this is most commonly caused by low levels of vitamin D. Osteomalacia is also considered the adult form of Rickets. Rickets takes place in children. This occurs when the child has a Vitamin D deficiency. Their bones are softened, distorted, and most of the time, bow inwards. They need medications, increase in Vitamin D in their diets, and in some cases, surgery. Another condition, like osteomalacia, is osteoporosis, which stops your bones from creating more bone mineral since some is lost. This causes your bones to become brittle and puts you at risk of fractures from things as simple as bending over. Bone density is gradually lost after peak bone mass is reached. This usually happens around ages 50-70. These conditions are most commonly diagnosed using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The DEXA scan works by sending two low dose X-rays, these two X-rays are absorbed differently by bone and tissue. The density profiles that are a result of this test, can then be used to calculate bone mineral density. There are also less common conditions, such as rickets in children.  There is also an increase in bone fractures when there is a Vitamin D deficiency.   A large group of 379 adults from northeast England that were aged 70 years or older, were randomly assigned to three groups of different doses of vitamin D. One group received 12,000 IU, The second group received 24,000 IU, and the last group received 48,000 IU. Each dose was given once a month for 12 months. A dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry was used to measure the bone mass density at the participants hip. They measured each participants hip BMD before the experiment for a baseline and at the end of the experiment. The participants had to be 70 years of age or older, from northeast England. The participants could not have had an antiresorptive or anabolic treatment for osteoporosis in the previous three years. They could not have been taking a current supplementary vitamin D of greater than 10 micrograms or a calcium dose of greater than 500 mg/d. The participants could not have experienced a fragility fracture in the past 6 months. Each participant could not have a history of renal stones, previous bilateral hip replacements, or primary hyperthyroidism. The participants could not have a past or present history of hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml. There was no change in bone density after the 12 months of taking the vitamin D supplement. But there was also no decrease in the participants bone density, which may also be seen as a positive. The benefits outweigh the downsides because at the end of the experiment researchers found that the participants had an increase in plasma. Since there was no change then this study shows no association.   One of the studies shortcomings is that the study was done in Northeast England, which has different amounts of sunlight that the U.S., so the results are hard to compare to Americans different amounts. Another flaw in the study design is that they allowed patients who already take a daily vitamin D supplement to continue to take that daily vitamin throughout the experiment along with their dose each month. Having the patients take a daily vitamin D supplement along with a higher dose monthly vitamin D supplement could possibly skew the results.   Another shortcoming was that this study shows no association between a higher or lower dose and amount of bone mass density in the different spots on the recipients. Along with this, it does not have a large group of participants in the study. There could have been a wider variety of ethnic groups and cultures. Different ethnic groups would probably have a different outcome as some may have more or less Vitamin D in their lifestyle coming into this study.    Vitamin D is absorbed orally from food and supplements and/or from the sun. We absorb Vitamin D from the sun through the skin. Our skin absorbs UV B radiation, which is then converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is created through the UV rays interacting with our skins protein, 7-DHC. Vitamin D through food and supplements is absorbed through the small intestine, with the help of simple diffusion. Vitamin D has many imperative rolls in your body such as regulation of calcium absorption, immune system function, and growth of bones. All of these rolls help improve blood sugar levels, lower risk of certain cancers, and decrease risk of depression. About 42% of Americans are Vitamin D deficient, So you are probably wondering, is this curable? Luckily, it is! Doctors treat this condition by prescribing vitamin D supplements, and an increase in sunlight. For more severe cases like osteoporosis and osteomalacia are usually cured with a weekly pill and diet modification. Because these conditions are more serious, they take more time to cure. Sadly, osteoporosis can never be fully reversed, just managed and one can build up some bone strength, but it can never fully go away. Osteomalacia, however, can be healed in 6 months, but sometimes longer.   Peak bone mass is reached by age 25. The years leading up to this time are very important, because if you do not reach your peak then you are putting yourself at risk for osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and vitamin D deficiency later in life. The greater the peak bone mass, the greater protection from these dangerous conditions you have. As these conditions are seeing an increase across the world, as adults we should see this as a warning. This is also why children are more susceptible to breaking bones, along with being clumsy and foolish. While we do need to spend time in the sun and exercise, we should also take the precautions to not make dumb mistakes or accidents that put us at risk of damaging our bones, especially at the ends of each, as those are still growing. You may have heard of breaking at the bone plate, which can stunt growth. As one grows, the vitamin D is extremely helpful to continue to grow bones at the bone plates, which continue to develop until 16-18 years of age. While bones stop growing, the density continues until middle/late 20s, typically around year 25.",0

"[deleted]",3,3,"How to gain weight?","I'm not sure if this is the right sub but I've tried everywhere else and they say no medical issues allowed so I'm hoping I'm allowed to post this here.

I'm a 17f and this summer holiday, I've lost 2-3kgs. Not intentionally and it's getting unhealthy. I'm getting dizzy easily and I don't even have the strength to pull down the handbrake with one hand (even with two hands, I struggle). 

I am not purposely trying to lose weight but food just doesn't interest me. It's not tasty or fun or whatever people like to say about it. 

My biggest problems seem to be:

- chewing too slowly so I get full quicker (takes me 20 minutes to finish chewing meat and fibres sometimes)
- because of this, I instinctively drink a lot of water when I'm starving, making me bloated and giving the illusion of fullness.
- I lose any and all interest in my food after a few bites. If I'm hungry, I'll devour it but the moment I need to stop stuffing my mouth and start chewing, I've lost all interest in the texture and taste of the food. I just stop finding the food delicious after already having tried it. I know what it tastes like now, I find no reason to continue (and physically impossible sometimes).
- my poor executive function makes it near impossible to cook meals so I resort to instant ramen for 80% of my meals. I can't finish a single serving of ramen if it isn't insanely spicy.

I've tried eliminating distractions during my meal, I've tried talking with family during my meal, my eating continues as the same. It doesn't help that I'm insanely picky and refuse to try new foods, resulting in me eating what I already know which then results in me stopping sooner.

And I'm not stopping or leaving food because I'm full, I could be starving but I'll still stop eating just because the food isn't appealing anymore. I physically won't be able to force myself to continue eating after this point. 

I also wake up extremely later in the day and skip breakfast because breakfast makes my stomach hurt like a bitch. This leads to my first meal being at around 12-1pm which means I don't get hungry until 5pm and by that point, I just wait until 7pm for dinner. No snacks in between because I don't like snacks. Breakfast is usually ramen and dinner is usually rice with korean stew and side dishes but I almost always only eat half the bowl of rice. Sometimes when I do eat at 10am, I forget to eat lunch/forget that I'm hungry (I just get used to the feeling of being hungry and don't register it as me needing food) until 3, 5pm. I'll usually have an early dinner then because the moment I recognise the hunger, it gets unbearable. 

For context, I'm 165-7cm and 45kg and I look like a skeleton. My parents' friends comment on it whenever I see them and many people have told me to gain weight. I get lightheaded if I stand up after sitting down for a long time and apparently my blood pressure is on the lower side. I bruise easily so exercise scares me but I want to be healthy instead of being a borderline walking skeleton. I get exhausted after 20 minutes of walking which is insane. I volunteered to participate in a school festival in a dance group but the members told me to gain weight because my moves looked awkward and powerless without fat in my arms. I went to a job interview and the interviewer said I weighed more than I looked so I'm guessing I look really bad from stranger's eyes :( 

I have had an eating disorder in the past (not diagnosed) but this has nothing to do with that. All the effects that the disorder had on my body are gone now and I just want the strength to pull my car keys out of the ignition ;-;

I apologise if this post sounds like I'm boasting about my weight. I've tried to talk to some friends about it and they've all told me that I sound like an asshole when I say this stuff so I'm really hoping I don't come off like that. 

Tl;dr: I lose all interest in food after a few bites and stop eating even if I'm hungry. I have two meals a day 99% of the time and no snacks in between. My meals are usually instant ramen and a korean meal.

Potatoes: they're a better option than cereals (wheat, rice, corn) and provide fewer calories per 100 grams. They have fiber, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, C, high potassium, and some minerals and tiny amounts of all esential aminoacids). At the same time, potatoes can replace flour in order to avoid all those chemicals and ""enrichments"".

Chard: it has high amount of Vitamins A, C, E, K, fiber and mineral traces with little calories.

Eggs: they're cheaper than meat and cheese, and their organic version is cheaper than organic meat too, while they provide B12, nice fat and nice sterols (HDL), and enough protein. It's actually the perfect protein. They have only 155 calories per 100 grams. Having into account that they provide B12, it's nice. Plus: it doesn't necessarily include animal suffering.

Flax seeds: They provide Omega 3, omega 6, and lots of fiber. It's a good, cheap seasoning.

The first version had very basic features and a pretty crappy interface serving just as something we could share around to gather feedback on. Since the response we had was overwhelmingly positive, we invested a little more time in to making this current version (which I know is still very simple) that weve now released to start gathering a bit of a community and understand what people like/dislike about our website so we can rapidly improve it over the next few weeks.

"simo30072012",1,1,"Top 10 sports supplements: what, who, and for what","The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) stresses that the basis of a good training and high-performance program is a healthy, nutrient-rich diet.

What role does sports nutrition play in this and is it really necessary? Analysis by MedAboutMe.

## What is sports nutrition?

Sports supplements are now a multi-million dollar industry. Athletes and people with active lifestyles come after attractive advertising from marketers. They promise high performance, increased strength and stamina, increased muscle mass, an endless source of energy, and help with weight loss.

Experts estimate that between 39% and 89% of the international sports supplement market is used by elite and older fitness athletes. At the same time, the lack of quality control of nutritional supplements, as well as clear requirements for their composition, leads some people to take ineffective products.

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only a small fraction of nutritional supplements that promise benefits in sports are confirmed in clinical studies. Many supplements, despite their high price, do not guarantee safety and are ineffective in improving sports performance.

## How should an athlete eat?

People who participate in sports must have a balanced diet containing sufficient quantities of all the nutrients necessary for health. At the same time, scientific studies show that a balanced diet cannot always meet the needs of a person who engages in intense physical activity.

""The study of the diet of athletes of both sexes has shown a deficiency of one to several essential vitamins and minerals in the diet,"" explains Daniel Gastelou, physical trainer and expert in nutritional supplements.

The important thing is that the athlete's daily menu is a variable component that changes according to the energy needs of the individual and the goals he or she sets at the time.

* Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for an athlete. The amount of carbohydrates in the diet is determined by the intensity of training and can vary from 45-65% of the total calories entering the body.
* Protein is responsible for the growth and recovery of an athlete's muscles. The body's protein requirements can range from 2 to 8 grams per kilogram of an athlete's body weight per day.
* Fat helps maintain the body's energy balance, regulate hormones, and restore muscle tissue. A 2018 study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends that athletes consume about 30% of their total calories from healthy fats.

## Most popular sports supplements

Here are several types of sports supplements. Some of them help to gain muscle mass, others help with weight loss and body fat ""burning"", and still others help with recovery after intense exercise.

It is important to keep in mind that a single intake of a nutritional supplement does not change anything in terms of health, sports nutrition is taken daily in short or long courses. How does it work? How not to get confused when choosing it?

### 1. Protein

Help fitness athletes to gain muscle mass and increase the relief of the body. They contain from 70 to 95% protein. There are several types of protein: whey, casein, egg, meat, and soy. All of them complement each other.

Experts believe that taking one type of protein will not give the same significant result as a mixture of several supplements at once. Usually, proteins are taken 2 to 4 times a day.

### 2. BCAA Complex

Combines 3 amino acids - isoleucine, valine and leucine. This ""troika"" represents about 40% of all essential amino acids present in the body's muscle tissue. During intense loads, their intake is consumed first, which explains the need for their intake. In addition to the fact that they contribute to the increase in muscle mass, they are involved in various biochemical processes.

You can take them in the morning after waking up, as well as before, during, and after training.

### 3. Winners

This name hides a mixture of protein (most often whey) with a carbohydrate complex. The ratio of carbohydrates to protein may vary depending on the manufacturer of the product. For some players, carbohydrates represent 1/2 of the weight of the product, for others, proteins represent 1/3 of the weight. Vitamins, enzymes, and other useful substances are often used as additional components.

Players usually take it once a day. Their main goal is a total body weight package (i.e. fat content as well as muscular mass).

### 4. Creatine

This is a natural substance found naturally in fish and meat: tuna, herring, salmon, and beef. It helps support muscle growth, promotes faster recovery after workouts, and improves strength performance.

Creatine is available in powder or capsule form for a single dose. The products are usually dissolved in sweetened fruit juice and drunk after training. After 4 weeks of use, advanced athletes recommend a 2-3 week break.

### 5. Amino acid complexes

These are commercially available in tablet, liquid, and capsule form. Unlike BCAAs, complex amino acids contain their full set of both essential and non-essential. These supplements help build muscle mass and increase strength. They are usually taken several times a day, such as in the morning, before and after training.

From the point of view of the advisability of taking amino acids, there are many opinions. But many experts are convinced that if an athlete consumes protein and gainers, amino acids cannot be taken. Otherwise, amino acids in the diet are highly desirable.

### 6. L-carnitine

This is a non-essential acid that in the body is found mainly in the liver and muscle tissue. Athletes are primarily interested in it as a fat-burning catalyst, as L-carnitine transports fatty acids to the cellular mitochondria. Another important quality of this supplement is that it provides extra energy for training.

It is usually taken twice a day - immediately after waking up and before training.

### 7. Omega-3

Polyunsaturated fatty acids have a range of health benefits. They stimulate muscle growth, protect joints and ligaments from overload, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and increase endurance. There is also evidence that they have a positive effect on testosterone synthesis.

A common source of omega-3 is fish oil, familiar to many from childhood. However, essential fatty acids can also be purchased in their pure form - as sports nutrition or pharmaceutical preparations. Take supplements 2 to 3 times a day with meals.

### 8. Fat burners

This is one of the most controversial sports supplements, and the timeliness of taking it is still controversial among experts in the field. Marketers are convinced that such supplements ""burn"" the fat layer while leaving the muscle mass intact. The mechanism of their action is based on the stimulation of metabolic processes, a decrease in appetite, the elimination of fluids from the body, and an obstacle to the synthesis of fat.

Fat burners come in several forms: thermogenic (increase body temperature and metabolic rate), lipotropic (promote the breakdown of fat), blockers (prevent the absorption of fat and carbohydrates from food), and appetite suppressants.

### 9. Vitamin and mineral complexes

Their reception for athletes has long been the norm. They help meet the body's needs for essential nutrients. It is especially important to consume them during the cold season when the diet is depleted of vitamins and minerals.

Such supplements increase the general tone of the body and strengthen the immune system, contributing to rapid recovery after training. Take these with food once or twice per day.

### 10. Energy

This is the fastest way to generate a burst of strength and energy at the right time. Energy drinks relieve fatigue and increase concentration and focus. They usually contain guarana extract, caffeine, and other natural stimulants.

Energy drinks are produced in the form of powder to make drink, gel, and ready-to-drink versions.",2

Dinner varies but is typically some kind of red meat (steak, pork/lamb chops) with broccoli, cauliflower, a carrot and a handful of peas.

I have been vegan for 6 years now, and generally eat pretty healthy. I love to cook and normally eat a lot of veggies, beans, rice, tofu etc. however its been really hard in college because I dont have access to a kitchen and the dining hall food sucks. Im pretty physically active so I need to eat a lot to feel satisfied but there arent so many options. What Ive been doing is eating salads at the dining hall and having oatmeal, pasta, and beans in my dorm room to supplement (I do have a microwave). 

The thing is, I am used to having large portions of healthy satisfying food and I dont really have access to that here. So Ive been eating a lot of protein bars and chocolate which I hate because I dont want to be eating all this added sugar. I feel like I can only feel full if I eat a couple of energy bars but theyre basically junk food, not to mention expensive. 

Sometimes I am so hungry that I just eat the dining hall prepared food and feel like crap for days. (I dont have food sensitivities but I am attuned to my body and know that I feel gross after eating food that is overly processed or has weird shit thrown in.)

I'm seventeen years old and still living with family. I really want to start eating healthier and I've been trying for a while now but it's proving to be very difficult.

I love with my grandparents who buy the groceries and cook dinner everyday. Eating their dinner is not an option as they get mad when I don't.

The groceries they buy tend to not be very healthy which makes making breakfast and lunch really difficult. We barely have any fruits or veggies most days, except for frozen blueberries, apples and carrots. When we do have other fruits or veggies it's because my grandmother bought it specifically for something and I'm not allowed to use it.

They eat in a very meat and carb heavy way which is something that I'm generally trying to avoid for health reasons. Due to medical reasons, meat and carbs are difficult for my body to break down and make me feel quite tired and sickly.
The average dinner we have is a meat, then rice or potatoes, and then a small portion of boiled veg. Sometimes we have salad on the side, but the salads tend to be pretty much just lettuce and chopped carrots and are not very good.

So, quick background: I (28F) used to be quite physically fit with little active effort.

(I'm 5'3 and about 230 pounds at the moment.)

My doctor is not concerned with active weight loss right now -- she and my physical therapist both want me to focus on building up muscle before anything else. (If she thinks weight loss will be best for my health later, I will 100% follow whatever recommendations she has then.)

I've been doing PT for a few months and have gained back an enormous amount of strength compared to where I was before. I'm nowhere NEAR able-bodied yet, but I'm getting there -- no more need to wear braces on my legs or lie down suddenly in public places!! :D

I exercise for 1 to 2 hours per day, excluding occasional illness flares. Half of the exercise is strength training through my PT exercises, the other half is walking around my neighborhood for cardio/endurance purposes.

My two main problems are these:

1) I am DESPERATELY hungry literally all the time, which I know is sort of expected when you're strength training, but does stress both me and my household budget. What kind of protein &amp; carb content should I be aiming for to help with hunger?

2) I grew up food insecure with parents who didn't cook -- I am learning to cook now, but very very very slowly, as I don't find it super intuitive yet.

I do not moderate how much I eat. For lunch I had leftover grilled chicken, fresh blackberries, pineapple, and blueberries. For dinner I had a simple salad, baked potato, half a rotisserie chicken, some cantaloupe, and a bunch of steamed broccoli. In both cases I ate until I was full.

"No_Reveal3451",1,1,"Making chipotle chicken bowls at home was&exhausting.","I started at 5:30 PM by adding one cup of rice to my rice cooker with 1 1/4 cups of water and rice vinegar.  

My GF came over at 6:30 with all of the ingredients from the store.  Everything we needed ran about $40.  This didnt include the rice, tomatoes, or seasonings that I had at home.

The chicken took the longest to cook.  I split three breasts into six strips, seasoned with garlic powder, and cooked them in two cast iron pans on the stove.  Once they were finished, I diced them into cubes, dumped them back into the pans, and simmered them in water with taco seasoning until the water was gone.  After the water was done boiling off, I scooped all of the chicken into a meal prep container.  This took a while.  I hate cooking chicken, especially when there is an extra step involved with the taco seasoning.  

While the chicken was cooking, I diced two tomatoes.  I decided against making pico de gallo since there are just so many more ingredients involved in making it correctly.  I also diced an onion and an avocado to put on top.  Its annoying since I had to keep flipping the chicken while dicing everything.  

I also grated some cheddar cheese, opened up a can of refried beans, and chopped up a head of Romain lettuce.  Once that was done, I took everything that was chopped and put them into bowls to serve.  Each bowl required its own serving spoon so not to cross contaminate.

I used two meal prep containers to load the ingredients into.  Standard kitchen bowls are just too small.  I scooped in a layer of rice, chicken, beans, tomatoes, avocado, salsa, sour cream, onions, lettuce, and finished with a sprinkling of cheddar cheese.  

By the time we sat down to eat, I was honestly exhausted.  The bowls were good.  Not quite as good as Chipotle, for reasons I dont entirely understand. The kitchen was completely destroyed, and I have yet to arise from my food coma to clean everything up.  

My GF and I agreed that for the amount of work that went into these chicken bowls, we probably would have been better off just going to Chipotle. $10 per bowl honestly isnt that bad. 

Making your own food can be healthy and rewarding, but its far from easy, and it can be quite exhausting.   Cooking is just really labor-intensive, especially if you want to make something thats really good.

Edit: I forgot to add that we didn't sit down to eat until about 8 PM.  I didn't have the kitchen cleaned up until about 9 PM.  None of what I described even took into consideration the time my GF had to spent shopping for all of the ingredients.  We both feel like we ate a full, healthy dinner, but lord god I wish it wasn't so exhausting to cook healthy food from scratch.",8

The idea is that diets are hard and typically don't help the average person succeed at improving their health long-term.

So this tool helps you replace your unhealthy over-processed high sugar foods in your pantry with better, healthier alternatives that taste good, have less sugar and less carbohydrates.

"rationalunicornhunt",6,6,"Intuitive eating has become a religion! Just like other fad diets!","I liked intuitive eating to some extent because it's against extreme fad dieting and other unhealthy things like that, but now it has become it's own ""diet"" with ""rules"" that people try to follow in a really rigid way.

While I love listening to my hunger and satiety cues like the framework suggests and I like a few other things, I don't accept the idea that we should give ourselves unconditional permission to eat anything and whenever and however much we want to....because some foods are harmful when we over-eat them...and some foods are more likely to result in health issues and excessive weight gain...

I feel like I want to follow some of the principles of intuitive eating that make sense, like using a hunger scale to determine if I need to keep eating instead of sticking to rigid and arbitrary caloric goals...

However, I see that a lot of people who do intuitive eating keep binging even though it was supposed to help with that and I kept binging too while trying to do everything by the book.

What made a huge difference in avoiding binges for me is actually asking myself: ""is what I'm about to do actually kind to my body? What would someone who loved themselves and cared about their health do in this situation?"" because then I don't end up binging if I ask myself those questions.

I'm just wondering if anyone else here is into healthy eating and against diet culture but has found that every eating framework is turned into some kind of obsessive religion by people...

I seriously think the healthiest thing is just a balanced diet that contains the 3 macros in relatively similar proportions and lots of fresh fruit and veggies....and lean protein and healthy fats, and maybe some whole grains (unless you struggle digesting something)...

The reason why people often feel good at first on fad diets because it's better than the American diet they were on before that, but a lot of these fad diets have long term negative consequences and so does intuitive eating.

Why is it necessary for people to turn even something like intuitive eating into a religion?

"Environmental-Food36",1,1,"Rate my diet (18M, 178cm, need to bulk)","When I was little I always had a very low appetite and there were days where I was ""able"" to eat a single moderate meal+when I started working out I had a chaotic workout program, not having a single pause between sets (chest-&gt;back-&gt;legs, repeat), that insane cardio and that low calorie intake (they surely were days where I had under 1000kcal per day) led to me having very little mass. October 2023 I had only 54kg, I tried donating blood but wasn't able to, I had already tried bulking for the past year to some extend, but that event really hit a spark in me.

Fast forward, I really ate a lot per day, not necessarily a good, diverse diet, but it still was lot, so much that there were several days when I was feeling like vomiting, and I currently have 59kg, although at the beggining of 58kg the progress got really, really slowed. Point is, things with a lot of calories from simple sugars REALLY affected my overall mood and thinking for certain periods, for that reason, I limited my simple sugars to strictly natural sources, occasionally honey. I also remarked that junk food which contained MSG, unhealthy fat and others additives made me crave them into more, temporary impairing my thinking and clearance of mind.

Apart from sugar and addictive additives which I already know created cravings, therefore impairing my clearance of mind and mood, I started feeling in a lot of horrible ways, and I suspected it was from some kind of vitamin deficiency. I started taking a lot of supplements (feeling that especially Omega-3 and Ashwaganda helped the most) and concentrated more on taking protein after work-outs and having a good amount of protein per day.

My ""plan"" was this, please critique it as much as there is to critique:  
So, apart from high-calorie junk-food, eating to gain weight would also mean getting more body-fat, which isn't what I really wanted since I barely made out of the skinny-fat problem two years ago, plus I run, a lot, so more body fat wouldn't benefit me too much. I researched about what happens with extra-protein and when would it be considered ""extra"", and I drawed the conclusion that while my first interest was to gain weight, I would rather like not gaining useless body fat while feeling horrible and then do a cut, but just increase the muscle mass. Muscle density is higher than body fat density, therefore my overall volume can be the same, but with more mass. Therefore there are several days where I take 100g+ of protein per day, usually the days when I work out, even though it can be just 2 sets.

Currently, I am happy with my diet of 2000kcal+ per day, 80g of protein+ per day, no junk food and no added sugar, also no feeling horrible for whatever reason, but is it enough, is it too much, and can it potentially lead me to any long-term problems?

Diet:  
-daily  
2-3 eggs in the breakfast with varying type of bread, alternating the cooking oil with EV Coconut oil, EV Olive Oil and animal fat if available (sometimes with dill, parsley and tomatoes)  
50-100g of nuts per day (either pure nut butter from almonds, cashews and hazelnuts, either simple nuts as snacks, including pumpkin and sunflower seeds)  
600ml-800ml of milk per day/kefir  
50g of whey protein/casein (with added bromelain and digestive enzymes)  
50-100g of sorghum porridge  
2g of grounded cinnamon (in the protein shake)

-some times per week  
meat, mostly poultry, rarely red meat  
fruits, especially bananas and citrus  
teas, mostly white tea and other real teas, occasionally herbal  
cereals and wholegrains other than sorghumchia seeds  
any kind of cheese  
honey in coffee or tea

-some times per month  
potatoes (in any way)  
chicken soup, usually with organs  
if in need of flour to cook something, chickpea flour  
mac and cheese with a personalized mix which includes nutritional yeast  
mung beans  
white rice  
whatever my parents make me, usually meat with some kind of side dish with legumes or pasta

Supplements:  
Omega-3 (daily)  
Vitamin D (daily)  
Multivitamin (C, E, B1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12 , Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, Selenium) (sometimes per week)  
Ashwaganda (daily)  
Chlorella (I take 1-3 times per week, to detox the possible heavy metals from the diet or supplementation)

"HetvenOt",4,4,"Where can I start eating healthy/changing lifestyle?","Hey,

  
I wanna change my eating habits a bit, but I would like to ask you guys some questions. Just some backgrounds to understand my questions a bit more clearly. I am 29, quite tall (190/6'3) a bit above of average in weight (100-105kg)compared my height, have some muscle and physically kind of active, as walk a lot and train weekly 3-4 times. When I was 18 I was pretty fat, I came down from 165(kgs) to 90(kgs) and since then my blood sugar, cholesteryn and a lot of my similar stats have changed in the good way. 

  
Lately I have just noticed my energy level (especially on the morning) is pretty low, even though use to sleep good. And btw, never smoked, since I dont like alcohol I dont drink at all (except cola), and (that is probably the weirdest) I do not drink coffee at all. But here is my questions. 

  
1, What does actually mean to eat healthy? - I tried to look up on the internet but site by site recommended different food with some mutuals (like Kale, Quinoa, fish). I grew up on near to the Balkan and people said and believed like vegetables, fruits and meat as healthy. But for example a lot of sites on the internet don't even recommend red meat, while some body builder influencers only eat red meat to get healthy(carnivore diet for example). So for these reasons I am a bit confused. I started to eat Apple and orange every breakfast, instead of sandwiches and bacon. And try to eat more fish and lean meat with steamed vegetables instead of rice.

  
2, Why some sites only recommend water as the only one drink I can pote? - This is my worst habit, I barely find the water potable. If i drink it, it is some mineral water (but as far as I know European companies they probably sell tap water with label). My favorite drink is a type of cola, that contains absolute zero sugar, but for exchange it has ASPARTAME in it. I have the same problem as I have in the previous question. Some sites says it is worse than sugar, some says it is good for a certain daily limit. 

  
3, What does absolutely recommended to cut out/avoid from my diet? - For example for years I ate sandwiches for breakfast, and nowadays when I started to read healthy eating articles and white bread is not recommended at all. 

  
Thank you for your help in advance.",3

I just completed the Prolon fast and I want to stick to a healthy diet for health and longevity, and hopefully lost some weight. I've have more than one ""wake-up call"" and I know I need to take charge of my health. But I am struggling!!! I am realizing just how addicted I am to all kinds of junk. It's really, really hard to not eat it and I find myself questioning my choice to give up unhealthy foods over and over. One example, I was a bar/grill/restaurant for a kids party tonight and I found myself wishing that I was having a couple beers and a plate of fries and mozzarella sticks or something, like grilled chicken sandwich, whatever... I couldn't STOP THINKING ABOUT IT! I started to feel really bad and almost kind of sad. Also when I got home my family was eating generic brand tortilla chips and cheese dip and chocolate bars! It's like I just want to join them, but I am unhealthy and I need to avoid this kind of junk food. It's crazy how driven I am to eat unhealthy food and I think it's ruining my life. And to make it harder my family is totally not on board. It's me alone trying to be healthy and avoid junk and it just feels completely overwhelming and a little sad.

"Skynet28",3,3,"Quitting soda ","Curious as to how everyone whose been through this addiction has managed it. I grew up in a huge soda addict household. I remember so clearly from my childhood how my mother would go through the McDonalds drive thru for soda day in and out sometimes more than once a day. 

So needless to say I never really learned just how bad soda was for you. Especially not as a relatively active teen that didnt see the consequences. Now as an adult its affected my teeth and my weight severely. 

Ive quit several times cold Turkey and found that when I go that way I never stay off it long term. This time Im trying to slowly cut it out. Currently I allow myself 1 soda day for every 2 non-soda days. In two weeks I plan to make that 1 soda for every 4 non-soda days and then another 2 weeks down to 1 soda day per week. Then 1 soda one day a week and then nothing. 

I know Ive read about finding a substitute to replace what I like about soda. Heres the problem for me. Ive found a substitute for the carbonation and caffeine. One thats low calories, no sugar, no corn syrup, etc etc etc. but I turn to soda as a stress reaction. Ive read that drinking soda releases the feel good chemicals in our brain. So whenever Im feeling stressed out, I automatically want a soda even if Im not craving it for any other reason. My substitute doesnt give me that feel good reaction. As far as limiting stressors. I just moved half way cross the country, switched job, and am in a rental while trying to buy a house. So probably not going to happen until Im settled.

When I turned around 20 or so, I started really eating ""healthy"", or at least attempting to. But then late at night, I'd have a massive thirst for sweets (especially chocolate, I wanted it after every big meal). I'd have a big eggplant parmesan sub or a steak n' cheese. Then, my hunger would kick in more. I'd now drive to a pizza shop and load up on some Sicilian slices. Then, all of a sudden, I wanted chocolate. This was an endless cycle for me for many years.

As I got older (Around 40), I noticed my blood pressure would boil at night when I went on the sugar rampage. My wife happened to be watching Dr. Berg one day and there was talk about what I was experiencing each and every day/night. Then I realized immediately, I need to cut sugar.

I started eating ""Keto Cups"", these organic chocolate cups from Whole Foods for a week. Then, my sugar cravings stopped! The problem was, I had to cut these too because the dark chocolate was filled with caffeine and would make my heart race.

I then found ""Hu Milk Chocolate Organic Candy Bars"" made with coconut sugar from Whole Foods. These wouldn't spike my blood pressure due to it not being fully dark chocolate, however I am lactose and notice it meses with me.

I then found ""Harmless Harvest Organic Cocoa Coconut Drinks"" from Whole Foods. It's basically coconut water + cocoa. I'm drinking about 5 of these a night right now and it at least got me off of sugar.

I know there is a ton of information out there, sometimes contradictory, and it can really make you feel overwhelmed and defeated.

The good news is, you dont have to overhaul your entire way of eating overnight.

In fact, making small but consistent and realistic changes is often times much more successful for long-term changes an all or nothing approach.

So, how can you start eating healthier?

If you are just starting out, maybe a big change for you might look like choosing healthier options at the restaurant. For example, choosing a vinaigrette instead of a creamy dressing, roasted potatoes instead of fries, or grilled chicken instead of chicken nuggets.

Lets say you have access to a kitchen but you dont have much time to devote to cooking.

A realistic step might be to buy chopped vegetables and fruits and pre-made salads. You can even go one step further and replace the unhealthy dressing that comes with the salad with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper.

What about if you wish to cook healthier dishes but you dont know where to start?

You might begin with looking up recipes of healthier versions of dishes you love. Like mac &amp; cheese but without the butter and flour. Or, a bun-less burger. How about a burrito bowl with brown or wild rice?

Pinterest, Instagram, and Tiktok are great sources for new and inspiring recipes.

Start thinking about what tiny changes you can make today.

What day of the week is the least busy for you? What meal can you start making healthier? Breakfast, dinner? Can you buy a healthier version of your go-to snack?

There are so many ways you can make small changes that compound over time.

"Heavy-Society-4984",1,1,"We always talk about weight loss, but what really matters are lifestyles that can sustain a healthy weight for a lifetime. Research suggests consuming less of certain nutrients, independent of calories, may significantly help prevent obesity and weight regain.","Obviously losing weight is important, but what does it matter if you just end up regaining it and becoming unhealthy again? Sure you can count calories and get down to a healthy BMI, but once you've reached goal weight, it's not practical to constantly count calories and control your portions for the remainder of your life. It's a big part of why so many people who've lost weight just can't keep it off. However, Research suggests some nutrients have a higher tendency to store more bodyfat than others, even when calories are equated. The kinds of food that show the biggest tendency to store fat appear to be saturated fats, added fructose, trans fat, and food cooked in deep fried oils. Oils cooked at high temperature for long periods tend to increase their saturated fat and trans fat content. It's also a good idea to opt for unrefined carbohydrates.

I will say that saturated fats on a ketogenic diet may not cause the same degree of body fat increase, due to keto's nature of metabolizing more fat than normal. The harm more so applies to saturated fats on diets that are also carb rich.

**Longitudinal association of dietary carbohydrate quality with visceral fat deposition and other adiposity indicators**

&gt;Results After controlling for potential confounding factors, a 3-point increment in CQI over 12-month follow-up was associated with a decrease in visceral fat ( 0.067 z-score, 95% CI -0.088; 0.046, p &lt; 0.001), android-to-gynoid fat ratio (0.038, 0.059; 0.017, p &lt; 0.001), and total fat (0.064, 0.080; 0.047, p &lt; 0.001). Fibre intake and the ratio of wholegrain/total grain showed the strongest inverse associations with all adiposity indicators.

&gt;Conclusions In this prospective cohort of older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS, we found that improvements in dietary carbohydrate quality over a year were associated with concurrent favorable changes in visceral and overall fat deposition. These associations were mostly driven by dietary fibre and the wholegrain/total grain ratio.

**Overfeeding polyunsaturated and saturated fat causes distinct effects on liver and visceral fat accumulation in humans**

&gt;Both groups gained similar weight. SFA (satyrated fatty acids) however, markedly increased liver fat compared with PUFAs (polyunsatured fatty acids);and caused a twofold larger increase in VAT (visceral fat) than PUFAs. Conversely, PUFAs caused a nearly threefold larger increase in lean tissue than SFAs. Increase in liver fat directly correlated with changes in plasma SFAs and inversely with PUFAs. Genes involved in regulating energy dissipation, insulin resistance, body composition, and fat-cell differentiation in SAT were differentially regulated between diets, and associated with increased PUFAs in SAT. In conclusion, overeating SFAs promotes hepatic and visceral fat storage, whereas excess energy from PUFAs may instead promote lean tissue in healthy humans.

**Deep-frying impact on food and oil chemical composition: Strategies to reduce oil absorption in the final product**

&gt;The authors observed an increase in SFA content (from 13.6% to 21.6%) mainly of lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), and arachidic (C20:0). At the same time, there was a decrease in unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid (OA; C18:1), linoleic acid (LA; C18:2 n3) and ALA from 80.8% to 71.2% from the first to the sixth cycle. Moreover, the TFA content progressively increased (from 1.1% to 6.5%) (Sohu et al., 2020). These studies indicate that repetitive frying deteriorates the oil's fatty acid profile toward a higher content of SFA and TFA to the detriment of MUFA and PUFA (Cui et al., 2017; Flores et al., 2018; Sohu et al., 2020).

**Common questions and misconceptions about protein supplementation: what does the scientific evidence really show?**

&gt;A follow-up study compared two different dietary protein intakes (i.e. 2.3 vs. 3.4	g/kg/d) in resistance-trained males and females who underwent a traditional bodybuilding training program \[Citation64\]. Both groups experienced a similar increase in lean body mass; however, the higher-protein group (3.4	g/kg/d) experienced a greater reduction in fat mass. Furthermore, in an 8-week crossover study in resistance-trained males \[Citation28\], a high-protein group consumed significantly more protein (3.3		0.8	g/kg/day) and calories than the control group (2.6		1.0	g/kg/day), yet there was no change in fat mass. These studies dispute the notion that excess energy from protein alone promotes gains in fat mass; however, diets high in fats and/or carbohydrates and low in protein tend to promote greater increases in fat mass as well as body mass \[Citation6670\].

**Fat and carbohydrate overfeeding in humans: different effects on energy storage**

&gt;Carbohydrate overfeeding produced progressive increases in carbohydrate oxidation and total energy expenditure resulting in 75-85% of excess energy being stored. Alternatively, fat overfeeding had minimal effects on fat oxidation and total energy expenditure, leading to storage of 90-95% of excess energy. Excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate, and the difference was greatest early in the overfeeding period.

**Conversion of Sugar to Fat: Is Hepatic de Novo Lipogenesis Leading to Metabolic Syndrome and Associated Chronic Diseases?**

&gt;Likewise, in the fed state, de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is also determined by the type of simple sugar consumed. Fructose, but not glucose, increased hepatic DNL in 6 healthy lean parti-cipants (Figure 3). During 6 hours of fructose inges-tion, DNL increased 20-fold, and 25% of circulating VLDL-TG was derived from DNL. In contrast, when the study was repeated in the same participants using glucose levels, rates of DNL were unaffected, and only 1% to 2% of VLDL-TG was synthesized de novo. These data dem-onstrate that fructose is a potent stimulus to lipogenesis.",0
