"Top_Cherry_4663",4,4,"Tips for client retention (private practice)","Hello! I am a dietitian with about 5 years of experience, I started a private practice a little over 1 year ago. Our main client base is referred from physicians, so it is largely chronic disease management and those looking for weight loss. Majority have insurance coverage. Some clients have self referred via practitioner directories from their insurance. 

Recently I have been wondering if there is anything I can do to help with retention of clients. I have had a few clients who had their initial appointment but then never scheduled a follow up.

I find my strength is listening, the initial assessments have all gone well in my eyes, I developed good rapport, it was very conversational in nature, they seem to feel comfortable and I find clients have really opened up in these sessions and there is good discussion. No concerns or outstanding questions voiced by clients.

I dont think rapport building is my issue but I wonder if maybe I could do a better job of explaining what to expect with future appointments to have them come back? How would you go about this?

My thought is people feeling they arent getting enough out of the first session however of course this can be difficult as we do the full health and social history, diet history  etc. I try to give one solid goal to work on for next time, i also dont want to overwhelm by touching on too much on the very first session. Time is also a limit as there is only so much you can do in 75 mins. 

Any thoughts? Since I am new to PP I want to learn and continue to improve my counselling. Thanks in advance! ",5

"mochiicecream0",2,2,"Supplement B12 for ICU patient?","So low hgb/hct  and high MCV and MCH is possibly linked with B12 deficiency anemia. I have an ICU intubated patient with AHRF, and myosititis (I had no idea what this was till today) with these labs (though they weren't like drastically low H/H or drastically high MCV/MCH). There was no history of anemia in her chart, but she hasn't been eating much \~50% maybe.

During my internship, my preceptor immediately recommended IM B12 injections and then a daily oral B12. Would you recommend B12 supplementation immediately or ask for serum B12 and MMA labs before recommending them? Technically excess B12 is excreted in urine so I thought maybe its safe to do so...?

She is a Registered Dietitian and CDCES certified working as a Nutrition Program Manager, managing 3 RDs, Org-wide Programming, Community Health Workers, all while seeing patients as well, but... **WE REALLY NEED SOME HELP WITH OUT OF STATE LICENSING**

I have seen posts in here that tell **nightmarish** stories about having to wait 4-8 months for online apps to be approved. I have also seen in here that people had to drive to Springfield, IL to expedite it and were in and out with their license in as low as 30 minutes!

Given the timeline we have been given by my job, we simple cannot wait for the 4-8month process, and she needs the license to be able to apply and explore her career opportunities prior to moving. We are supposed to drive up to Wisconsin to visit her family from Columbus and are considering adding **a 3hr stop in our drive to Springfield, IL** to expedite this process by going in person, but she was told on the phone by a manager that there is no guarantee that they even let her inside of the building...

I am far removed from the world of medicine, licensing, etc, but to ME, this process looks to be broken and full of incompetence on the state's licensing side... After seeing posts in here about people getting licensing online with ease in states like UT, AL, GA in a matter of 10 days, it makes absolutely 0 sense to me why Illinois would be that much different.

**I am really hopeful that you take the time to share your experience, feedback, or advice** on the Illinois Out of State licensing situation, as a core part of our relocation to the Windy City depends on her job. I will be working downtown in River North and am fine taking public transport for however long necessary, but my new biggest worry is something she takes great pride in, her career, being halted due to a faulty state licensing process.

"buckofive",152,152,"RD exam is an insulting measure of competence","I took the exam last week and did not pass. That exam was incredibly disrespectful to the amount of work we have done to get not only a bachelor's degree but a master's along with 1000 hours of internships. There were barely any clinical questions and we are supposed to be able to define a single correct term from things like the ""FOCUS"" model which uses one different word in the definition of the word which can be three other answers. And there's 10 other ""models"" we're supposed to know. I understand you're supposed to pick the ""best"" answer. But no one will be using these when actually practicing. The practice exams are a joke and no where near what the actual exam is like. For the academy to write these exams and think they are adequate in assessing competence is incredibly disrespectful and frustrating. We are not trying to become project managers. We are supposed to be clinicians. I understand some go into food service but even most of those questions are ridiculous. Half of the domains just feel like busy work they decided to add in because they couldn't think of enough content to make up the exam. There should be some type of review process for this exam because it is a joke. I may sound salty because I didn't pass but for having to spend $225 to take the exam on top of everything else we have to pay for is insulting. ",75

=¨ CALL TO ACTION: DIETITIANS, IT'S TIME TO SPEAK UP! =¨
CDR is failing dietitians. They are out of touch with the realities of patient care and the challenges we face. We have relentlessly voiced our concernsyet they continue to raise fees, impose barriers, and make our profession less accessible and more expensive while failing to secure higher pay or better working conditions.

=9 Masters Degree Requirement (2024)  Raising barriers but not our salaries.

 =9 RD Exam Costs &amp; Declining Pass Rates  Instead of fixing the problem, they bundle retake fees.

 =9 Annual Fees Increasing (2025 &amp; 2027)  More money for CDR, but no benefits for us. Where is the money going???

 =9 CEUs &amp; Licensing Fees  Expensive, burdensome, and favoring AND-affiliated programs, not independent RDs. 

 =9 Lack of Support for Non-Traditional Career Paths  Private practice, functional nutrition, and telehealth RDNs are left behind. START ADVOCATING FOR US!

=¬ WE ARE MAD. Dietitians deserve better. CDR and AND must be held accountable. We need transparency, fair wages, and real solutionsnot bureaucracy and fee hikes.

"Vanshita_pamnani",1,1,"Job or Self-Practice  Which Path Should I Choose?","Hey everyone, 

I need some advice on my career direction in nutrition and dietetics. Right now, I have about 4 months of internship experience in a hospital setting and have been working as a clinical dietitian for the past 2 months in a company. But honestly, it feels more like a calling job than actual dietetic practice. Most of my time is spent making calls to clients, and since the service is complementary, many dont engagesome hang up, dont answer, or arent really interested. On top of that, the job is heavily KPI-driven, which can be mentally exhausting.

Ive been thinking about shifting toward self-practice through content creation so I can build my own audience and work independently. Along with that, I also plan to do certification courses to upgrade my skills in this field. I really want to educate people in a way that actually makes a difference. But at the same time, Im applying for other jobs (with little success so far), and I know that most roles in this field will still have KPI-based targets. The only real advantage of staying in my current job is the work-life balance and timely salary.

So, at this stage, should I stick with my job despite these concerns or start focusing more on self-practice through content creation and upskilling? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would love to hear your thoughts!",3

About me:
I am currently working as a Clinical Dietitian in a respiratory sub acute (trach/PEG/vent).  The majority of my population is unfortunately, unresponsive.  The age range is mostly adults with the exception of a few residents who are under 30. Ive been in this role for ~18 months and it is my first real RD job.

1. Defining our objectives for change. Which are areas of concern in other profession are most important to address and unify our message. 
2. Curate a survey for RDs to contribute their voices! We want to know the top concerns and statistics from other dietitians to strengthen our case. 
3. Begin an online petition through change.org to rally numbers behind our signatures and gain public and professional support 
4. Draft a formal letter outlining our concerns and proposed solutions directly to the Academy and CDR.

"wingdings5",258,258,"CDR just gave themselves a multimillion dollar raise, while RD salaries remain stagnant.","Based on registry statistics on the CDR website, there are 113,067 RDs. Therefore, CDR is currently collecting (from RD annual registration maintenance fees alone), over $7.9m, and this will increase to $10.2m over the next two years. What is that additional $2.3m going towards? And I didnt even factor in DTR fees, exam fees, and fees for board certification. We need to ask ourselves, does an organization like this, which has not advocated for us one bit, really need over 10 million dollars to operate?

Im lucky to have finally landed a role in healthcare that is not in dietetics. However, because of this, I will be paying for the maintenance fee out of pocket for the first time in a while. And I question whether it is really even worth maintaining at this point. 

I feel for those that need to get a masters degree just to have a seat at the table. A table that will forever demand more of you while you struggle to make it work. Seven years of being a dietitian, and Im still feeling the financial implications of returning to school and choosing this career path. I didnt need a masters degree, but I was still required to obtain another bachelors, in addition to paying for an internship. 

Many RDs talk about the career without concern about money. Those individuals have living expenses that are subsidized by a family member, or they are perfectly fine living a very modest life. For me, I feel that all of the sacrifice should at least allow someone to pay down student loan debt in a timely manner, and maybe afford a modest vacation every few years, or a car that is reliable to get to work, or the ability to save enough to buy a home one day.

You cant support more than your basic living expenses on an average dietitian salary, yet the cost of maintaining the dietitian credential is rising. Make it make sense. ",62

I'm in the nutrigenetics space, and we have real, good science being done and a lot we can learn and do, and so much more possibility on the horizon. *However*, many business-minded folks have monetized findings in a way that doesn't sit well with me: The main way I see this happening (besides just offering a test for a price) is companies offer genotyping tests then selling you ""specialized"" supplements based on your genotype. In this situation, though, it's the same situation we see with supplements in general: The vast majority of people don't need this and can get the benefits cheaper and easier by just eating a varied, moderate, generally healthful diet. 

And I'm worried that this consumer-targeted CGM is another round of the same: By adding ""extra sciencey stuff"" people are going to *feel* like it's worth paying for, but the ""insights"" are going to be virtually worthless compared to general diet advice. 

If the glucose response varied that much by person to person based on food type, the concept of a glycemic index or a glycemic load wouldn't be possible, after all; and if someone's reaction to a food is so impactful as to matter, they can likely *feel* it without an app.

"TheMarshmallowFairy",16,16,"RD2B trying not to doom spiral about the near future","I live in the US, so&.. yeah. Every day, Im getting more disheartened about the future. I have a year left in my MS/DI, and until recently Ive been cautiously optimistic about the future (I am already anxious so never confidently optimistic because my brain wont let that happen). But lately, it takes everything in me to not cry every time theres a new story, and Ive been having to increase my medications to avoid panic attacks. 

I live in an area with a large low income population AND a large number of elderly people, so a larger proportion than average of people are on Medicare and/or Medicaid. With government cuts happening across the board, Im worried about my potential to find a job next year. If less people have access to healthcare, there will be fewer jobs. 

This also makes me worry that the abysmal pay here will get worse, or at least not improve, due to reduced demand and thus people possibly taking lower pay due to lower demands. Moving is not really a possibility. I am not a younger person with few responsibilities, I have a partner and kids and an established life here. If I moved, it would mean leaving my kids behind. I already feel like I dont get to see them enough between work and school and Im only 45 minutes away. I dont want to be even farther from them, so moving is literally an absolute last resort; I would keep doing Amazon Flex and Instacart instead to stay near them if I can. Im starting to feel like I will have to find a completely unrelated job just to stay in the area if I cant find a decent RD job.

This anxiety has been worsened by the changes to student loans. As an older student without familial assistance and kids to take care of, Ive had to take out loans to pay for school and for living expenses. I was mentally prepared to use things like income based repayment options and I was okay with probably having to pay more overall or taking longer to pay them back, but now Im terrified what my loan payment will be after school if they dont bring that back and Im only making $50k a year. I took out only what I needed, I have worked part time the entire time as well, and thankfully over 5 years Ive received about $20k in scholarships and another $50k in VA benefits that reduced my total loans needed, but fuck feeding and clothing four boys who are on track to be close to 6ft tall is insanely expensive so I still have a lot of loans. My oldest is about to be 15 and he eats in one meal what can equal to be my entire day of food!! Someone is always in a growth spurt and needs new clothes and/or shoes. And they go to a public school but it requires uniforms so theres another expense. 

I used to turn to social media to escape but thats not even possible anymore. Im inundated with posts about how seed oils are going to kill us or beef tallow is the cure for every ailment and parents doing stupid stuff like free births in the ocean or not vaccinating their kids and so.much.chemophobia or food shaming.

So Ive always been interested in psychology and with my last job I was introduced to trauma-informed care. Ive taken The Mindful Dietitians Trauma Informed Care in Dietetics course and it has opened my eyes to how trauma can manifest as physical pain when it goes untreated. Im also currently reading The Body Keeps Score and its fascinating. 

My occupation is a hybrid outpatient RD and I currently see patients with a broad range of conditions. I want to start focusing in on incorporating somatic therapies with my practice by Im not going to lie, Im nervous! I definitely know I need more training but dont know where to go from here. 

I have a family member who has healed her chronic pain/conditions through somatic therapy when no other doctor could help her out. She provided me with great resources read and listen to that her somatic therapist gave her. Im also in therapy myself and we lightly incorporate somatic practices but its nothing as intensive as my family member. 

Besides The Mindful Dietitian, does anyone have any specific resources combining dietetics and this scope of practice? I know it will take a couple of years to really grow into this type of work and be confident, but I need to start somewhere. Or does anyone have tips for incorporating light somatic work with their patients? 

So far Ive introduced this to a couple of patients who I know in my heart of hearts need this treatment, but I dont know if Im doing it the right way? If there even is a right way? Any advice is greatly appreciated! 

P.S. I ALWAYS make sure to tell my patients to bring this up to their therapist/mental health counselor because I know this is not in the roots of my education in dietetics. I just know this can help so many people and I want to be able to share these powerful tool with patients.  

P.S.S. The private practice where I work is so frustrating because there is almost no collaboration between the RDs because its a remote company.

"AltitudeSickness221",1,1,"Unusual path to RD advice needed!","Hi everyone. I've been a lurker for a while and appreciate the realness. I've gotten to the point where I'm ready to ask my own question.

I got my bachelors in journalism (very little science required fyi).

I followed that with a masters in applied nutrition because I developed a love for nutrition and decided I wanted to go into nutrition communication. This program never intended to result in an RDN credential.

In the time since I began my masters, more and more nutrition communication jobs are requiring an RDN-- even when it's clear by the job description my qualifications would suffice. I think they're trying to avoid ""nutritionists"" with 6 week certs-- and I honestly get that.

I currently work as a public health nutrition educator. I like it a lot, but opportunity for upward mobility or transfer to my desired job (ideally nutrition communication or nutrition policy) is improbable. 

I can't become an RDN easily because my BA undergrad didn't require the sciences necessary for a masters level dietetics program (like the simple ones-- chem, bio, etc). Taking the required courses ""a-la-carte"" would be costly out of pocket, even at a community college.

I have found a few programs where I could do an accelerated bachelors to meet the requirements to become an RDN... but I guess I'm not sure if that's the only way? 

I truly love working in nutrition, but recent world events have me really freaked out about finances. I'm at a crossroads.

I've heard that pay for dieticians is low, but all the jobs I'm looking at pay 2-3x what I'm making now. 

Does anyone have this backwards pathway of nutrition masters before a bachelors (or did you)? 

Knowing what you know now-- what would you do in my position?

Is there a career I'm overlooking that uses the credentials I already have? I feel I get no respect in nutrition spaces with my current credentials and worry I need to be an RD to be taken seriously and make the most of my educational investments thus far-- but what do you think?

She was spending ~$300/month on snack foods (Debbie cakes, chips) and drinking about three 24-packs of pop per month. She was on Ozempic, but her MD stopped it once she started ordering excessive junk food again.

With a lot of effort, I helped her get down to 350# by increasing vegetable intake, getting her to stick to facility meals, cutting pop to one per day, and increasing water. However, her mother recently fell, broke her neck, and is in critical conditionthis has caused a major relapse in her eating habits. She is lying to me about her intake, has zero self-efficacy, and seems resigned to staying in bed all day.

At this point, I feel like Im hitting a wall. Shes resistant to change, and I cant force her to make better choices. Has anyone worked with residents in similar situations?

* **Urine Calcium -** 310 mg/day - High  promotes calcium stones
* **Urine Phosphorus -** 1123 mg/day - High-normal
* **Urine Ammonia -** 60 mg/day - Elevated (&gt; 45)  suggests high acid load
* **Urine pH -** 6.5 - Slightly alkaline

Given these labs, what would your top recommendations be? low oxalate, uric acid, etc? its not specified what type of stone this is

this person also wants macro goals for weight loss and they're working with a personal trainer-- not overweight, so maybe 1.2-1.4g/kg? or 0.8-1g/kg d/t the kidney stones? emphasize plant-based proteins?

I get plenty of inappropriate referrals from providers who have patients with normal weight or barely overweight saying they want to list weight. 

I end up seeing these folks and have a long discussion with them about the necessity to lose weight slowly or seeking weight loss if it improves their health. Or focusing on lifestyle modifications that naturally lead to wt loss. I see looks of resignation and disappointment a lot with this. Has this happened to you? Whats your approach?

I also see folks who need to actually lose weight because they do have weight related complications. BUT when I see them I hear so much about cosmetic reasons being the primary motivator to wanting to lose weight. How do I reconcile with their motivations without further fueling disordered aging patterns or disruption in their body image??",12

I ask a lot of open-ended questions and ask them to expand on things, but I often still feel like we end up struggling to find things to talk about and it can be awkward. 90% of my clients are on telehealth and I honestly think that makes it worse because it is easier to build rapport face to face.

What is your practice?
1. If the quarterly ARD is 3/1, what day do you do your quarterly note. 
A. on the exact day 3/1. 
B. Within 7 days of the ARD, before or after (2/22- 3/7)
C. Within 7 days after the ARD
D. Other

I have some unit managers upset that I dont sign off on the Care plan review until after my assessment which might be the day after the ARD.

Obviously it's hard to help him gain weight due to many ONS options being high in protein. The only thing I can think of is calogen possibly?

"FantasticSign7472",21,21,"Is TPN indicated?","Patient at my hospital is demanding TPN but multiple hospital systems indicated shes not a candidate. For some background, pt has history of neurogenic bowel, oropharyngeal dysphagia and gastroparesis, POTS, ehlers-danlos syndrome. Has J-tube that has dislodged multiple times over the last few months and came out itself this week according to her. GI consulted and found the gut is functional and recommended staying on TF. She has volume intolerance with feeds, unable to take in more than 30-45mL or she experiences abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhea. Claims malabsorption and on elemental formula, however theres no documented proof of malabsorption. No weight loss per records but she claims weight loss. Her outpatient RD prescribed Vivonex 85mL/day (obviously shes not able to tolerate that). Shes refusing to have her J-tube reinserted, and she has a significant history of manipulating the staff to try and make other providers believe that they told her TPN would be started. Concern for Munchhausen syndrome but wont see psych.

Of course since gut is functional, we want to use it. However, it would seem to be impaired function. Considered partial TF + partial TPN, but patient doesnt want J-tube reinserted and wants full TPN. Hospitalist finds it unethical and wont order full TPN. With her significant medical history, at what point do you say weve tried it all. Any advice? 



Update: I appreciate all of your input greatly. As many of you pointed out, Munchhausens is at the top of our list of concerns here. Shes on probation for Munchhausen by proxy for over-exaggerating symptoms of her infant and having a G-tube placed. The psych history is very significant. Most of her diagnoses are self entered into the EMR system with no true diagnosis per her insurance case manager. Throughout her hospitalization with us, she has tried manipulating all of her providers by telling one provider that another provider approved TPN, when their notes clearly indicate otherwise. Despite this, Ive built good rapport with her, but she still wont budge and insists TPN. We had a team meeting with her where we all told her that we would not be pursuing TPN. Shes claiming that she has an initial G.I. appointment scheduled with a new provider next month and wants TPN as a bridge to that appointment. She refuses to share the information of that provider. Today, we offered her an NJ as a bridge and of course she refused. Shes been refusing psych since admission, but social work told her today that it is a condition of her parole to comply with psych. Now shes requesting transfer.

Heres my question now& Shes refusing all of the options that we are giving her, and cant tolerate oral feeds per her report. Do we discharge and say that she denied medical intervention, or are we going to have to offer TPN if she continues to deny? It seems unethical to discharge with no means of nutrition, even though it is her denying the options we have given.

Note, this is my 2nd year as a RD and this is my first inpatient job  Im the only RD in the hospital and have been here for 2 months. Im still learning the complexities of inpatient care and ethics with patients like this. So I appreciate you all and your advice :) ",16

I am a new graduate and seeking some guidance from experienced RDs. I have two job offers and I don't know which direction to take. I am worried to make a mistake. I would love to hear your expertise and guidance on my situation. I am located in Canada if that makes a difference.

**Job 1** \- Is a casual hospital position in pediatrics. I love pediatrics and would be excited to grow my clinical skills in this area. The pros of this job would be working alongside a RD team and continual mentorship to develop my skills. Cons would be that it is casual, so I am not guaranteed any hours. In my city, it is common for RDs to work 4-5 years as a casual before getting a full-time RD position. You can apply for other temp positions when they pop up (usually due to maternity leaves) in the meantime. This position has no benefits. Easy commute (20 min bike ride or 30 min bus).

**Job 2** \- Is a community position working with Indigenous populations.  Pros: Variety of work. Duties include working with medical clinics, community engagement programs, LTC, school nutrition, counselling, cooking demonstrations and basically anything the community would like support in. This position is full-time and has a benefits package. I am unsure of the specific benefits because the hiring manager said my offer letter is conditional on successful CDRE exam results, which I will find out in July.  Cons: I would be the sole dietitian for these communities, so I don't have a nutrition team to collaborate with. I would be driving to different communities every day (1-2 hrs) and be required to stay overnight at a community 1x/week. Driving is included as work time, so I would get paid for my commute.

I thoroughly loved my pediatric clinical internship and community rotations. My long-term career goals would be to work in advocacy, policy change or project management.  I do not see myself working as a front-line clinician for 30+ years. From a financial standpoint it is a no brainer to choose Job 2. But I guess job 2 comes with more responsibility and it is a little daunting to me. There are of course other community RDs I could reach out to for mentorship and support. However, I would be the sole dietitian at this organization and would lack day to day direct mentorship. I am also worried that I will be missing out by not developing my clinical skills. Most people from my cohort have accepted casual hospital positions, so I guess I am also scared to be doing something different. Job 1 is definitely more ""safe"".

This was after a series of educational classes on nutrition, exercise, behavior change where I thought I was making progress. Many of these people do not cook or prepare anything at all at home.

"Economy_Strawberry89",11,11,"Nutrition Support Teams: successes and blunders?","Hi, everyone! A surgical PA at my facility is trying to establish a NST for reimbursement purposes... interestingly without involving the Clinical Nutrition team at all. My leadership (Director of Nutrition) is reluctant for this NST to ever come to fruition, as they feel that we (the RDs) will essentially get pushed out of a job. 

The literature is abundantly clear that NSTs can provide a lot of value to any facility that is nutrition support-heavy. Thus far, I support it and of course would want to be involved every step of the way. 

Would love to hear any success stories of NSTs at your facility or even blunders/failures as well. Comment below and TIA! ",1

Has anyone here made a similar transition or added a counseling degree to complement their healthcare background? Was it worth it? Or did anyone go back to school for something entirely different after working as an RD? Id love to hear your thoughts or experiences!",13

Im 23 and 1 year out of undergrad I am starting to search for Masters programs, I also need to take classes for prerequisites so I have a lot of work to do. 

I know you have to become state certified but Im really wanting to get out of the state im currently in for grad school or for research opportunities. How difficult is moving as an RD and would it be a safe bet to stay in the state im in?

  
Also, with the state of education and the government, what would someone who has been through it recommend (hybrid, online or inperson) 

  
Thanks!

"Acceptable_Rip235",4,4,"Director of Food Service AND Dietitian","The Director of Food Services at my Rehab facility (at a national hospital company of Rehab and LTACHs) has departed due to some unfavorable actions. We have been open 3 months and patient safety was a concern and reigning in the staff in the kitchen to perform their duties as needed was never tackled. I was asked to step into the role ($500/pay period incentive) in the interim given the option to become DFS if I like the position or just hold things down until a replacement is found. I am currently the FT Clinical Dietitian for this 48 bed rehab and I love my job. I have cultivated a culture where our PM&amp;R MDs seek me out to address their patient needs, I am a value member of the staff everyone looks to, I have a seat at the leadership table every morning, I attend IDT (Team conferences) and have been praised by our Corporate Director of Quality and Case Management for the value I bring to the team meeting to the extent they are questioning why other RDs in the company don't do the same. I am making 85K with the CNO (my supervision) telling me I was first on her raise worksheet because the value I have brought to her isn't reflect in my pay.
All that being said I don't want to be banished to the kitchen when I'm doing such great work on the floor. But I can see the kitchen needs someone strong to lead and provide the best patient care and follow through for the plans I am implementing at the bedside. Is it worth me leading the kitchen team long term? I wanted to approach our CEO, who is nothing but supportive of me to the extent of offering to close our cafeteria to focus on patient care during this time of transition, regarding changing the structure of the department. I wanted to stay clinical lead and oversee the kitchen but I'd want them to create a Kitchen Manager position (a position in the company but not in our hospital that we would promote from within) to oversee ordering, scheduling, and day to day activities as well as a FT RD position (I am the sole FT with 1 day of PRN coverage and 2 open PRN positions with no bites in months due the changes in our profession I'm sure everyone is experiencing) who just assesses patients. I would handle the leadership level roles of both positions (Director of Food Service and Clinical Dietitian) such as performance improvement, quality, survey readiness, Team conferences, patient safety as well as seeing patients to support the FT RD (as I struggle to stay in compliance as the sole RD currently). I was under this structure at a previous hospital and it worked, I was the RD seeing patients with no obligations to attend leadership activities unless I was covering my boss the DFS who was an RD in the role I outlined).
What is your input on this? Has anyone worked in this sort of structure before as well? What do you think I should ask for salary-wise for this role? Give me the good and bad because I am nervous.",5

Here in Canada, the dietetic internship component can cost $250-$5000 depending on the program and is full-time, unpaid work.

"Aimeeboz",5,5,"Tapering TPN in a complex patient","I work in a SNF so I don't have too much experience with TPN.  I had a heck of a time with this as the order initially  a couple months ago did not have all the grams and I had to work backwards with the total fluids and what I did have. Solve for X is basically how I had to figure out her cal/pro when the MD wanted a gain, easiest was to increase the fat gm from 30 to 40gm and that seemed to do the trick. Slow steady gain ~2#/wk.

She has had a positive wt gain, 8# in a month. However she is complex, BMI is very low, improved to 13.4 from 11.1. And has a (improving) stage 4 to her coccyx.

MD advanced her diet as tolerated and ordered a consult to manage TPN  calories.

Her intake is around 25%. I'm my professional opinion I do not feel comfortable weaning her off yet until her BMI is at least 15 or is at least 100# (she is 67""). 

I feel if I did I would just do the reverse and adjust her fat grams back to 30gm.
But where to go from there?

She is on 1200ml 15% clinisol 50gm, dextrose 180gm, smoflipid 40gm (+ electrolytes and minerals) rate 50ml/hr

My wife is a dual US/Australian citizen and wanting to  pursue a degree in the US but we are looking at moving to Australia. 

I know the simple answer is take the course in Australia but she has the GI bill to pay for her college and most universities in Australia will not work with that. 

Has anyone gotten licensed in the US and worked over there? I've also thought about her doing it in the UK for transferability and me having a work permit there.

"Veg-travel",186,186,"Please stop taking low paid RD jobs","RD's (USA based as I can't speak to international RD's too many variables) please understand your worth. I still see people are offered and taking jobs that offer $30 USD per hour or less. (I know waiters in average restaurants nothing fancy that clear this very easily). Nothing wrong with being a waiter but as an RD with a Masters level education will spend a lifetime paying off those student loans at $30/hour and always feel under-appreciated and under-utilized for their knowledge. However, please do go for the job interview, but do not accept the job if it does not pay adequate for your years of experience and PLEASE DO tell them the pay is too low for your level of education/experience. By doing this it will help the profession, if we unite and turn down jobs with low pay.  Accepting this low pay is hurting the profession.

Also always ask if it is a W2 or 1099 and with or without benefits. This will make a huge difference in what is an acceptable pay range. Check out the federal governments pay scale for RD's (google it)this is a good payscale to begin your negotiations. It i a W2 with great benefits.

A brand new RD should be around $35 an hour/W2 with benefits. Experienced 10 + years, ICU NICU etc.  with additional expertise (CNSC etc.) never less than $45/W2 with benefits.

If you are a contractor on a 1099 no benefits the extra taxes will hit hard, so nothing less than $75/hour as a starting pay. $85-100 is more appropriate for your skills. Compare yourself to SLP, OT pay not the pay of RD's from the 1990's. ",76
